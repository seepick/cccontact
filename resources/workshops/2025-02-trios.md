INTRO TEXT:
    take the time to expand our CI duet, add another partner/s
    learn to play/ground/fly with one partner; then in trio/other group formation
    most accustomed to dance in a duet, with 1 partner sharing our weight/movement pathways
        once adding another element to this mix, different elements to consider/adjust/balance

* amazingly lots of awareness necessary, in trio and threesomes
  * many struggle already in a duette, few even with a solo
  * multiplying attention to two partners, oneself, the relationship-entity, and the "big body/space/other people"
* ad techniques: serve as a base when "losing the moment"
  * when things feel awkward, somewhere to retreat to feel comfortable again; a back-up (mode)
    * a common vocabulary helps to sync, to overcome that awkwardness
  * when disconnected, insecure about what you are doing...
    * once found connection again, go into free flow again
  * just like shiatsu: use meridians only when lost focus, and be guided by the (confident) moment
* a trio is like the three-body problem in physics/classical mechanics
  * although we don't really orbit each other, like sun-earth-moon do
  * it's not possible to predict with equation; it's chaos; small initial condition change, everything totally changes
* be fully present with your partner (being present, the biggest present there is)
    * constantly have an unconscious 3D model (of your partner/the situation/space) in your head; keeping track
    * also: understanding of anatomical possibilities/limitations (what's possible, think, and act according to it)
    * not dislocating your partner's shoulder, but also use some specific joint types to create certain moves
* how to join a duo
  * "am i welcome?" (-in this world)
  * sometimes you are NOT, wait for an explicit YES from everyone, don't force yourself onto them
  * feel free to step out if someone joined without you being able to give consent (love it, change it, or leave it)
  * no frontal approach; no eye-gazing (makes people uncomfortable, too direct)
  * slowly get closer, make yourself visible, get sure existence acknowledged/awareness
  * stay in respectful distance, only penetrate kinesphere once, step out again (crossed boundary here, it's ok)
  * wait for a clear, unmisunderstandable sign for being welcome (or not)
    * moving either closer, or further away; tensing up, losening up; closing or opening; frontal or sideways/back; breathing or silent; look at or away; smile or frown
    * wait for them to contact you, don't contact them (crossing boundaries); treat like a frightened cat
  * difficult to get consent from two people (compared to only one), thus need to put even more effort in it
    * required them not to be in a bubble (inwards), but have more space awareness (outwards)
    * otherwise very difficult/impossible to enter with consent; or just don't try if they are captured in their bubble
* same with leaving a trio
  * same time and effort put in, but then just reversed
  * gentle, soft, slowly... don't "drop" them
  * like a deep, tender connection, a string not to be raptured (like silk reeling in taijiquan)
* a trio is too much info to be processed conscious => you need to apply "jedi skills", to navigate it
* TECHNIQUE: "stairs"
  * two bases, flyer rolling form one onto the other
* too much wanting, not enough mushin/empty mind
  * still early years to be able to flow it
  * back-up to structure, as no true flow can be created yet
  * OR: keep it very very simple, technique low, thus skill (principles/quality) high
* with duo, easy to keep track, constant (rolling) contact, but with trio...
  * lots of jumping point of contacts, in the nature of it
  * need to use more visual information/eyes
  * use Jedi skill, rest into the unconscious knowing, relax and "trust the force", as "this is the way"
* difference support-base-decoration (although continuum, but for sake of simplicity simplify)
  * 1) support: things connected to the ground, static; when standing=legs
      * when moving it, balance impacted
  * 2) base: when standing, the center structure; standing=spine
      * not possible to be moved as weight rests on it; if would start to decorate, would fall
      * base is what connects support structure
  * 3) decoration: has no weight on it, no connection, free to do whatever and move freely (usually arms/hands/fingers)
      * when moving it, no impact (to balance)
  * an important skill, know where you can put your weight on your partner; needs to be support fast
  * base is between support structure, usually the CoM
  * when CoM is above support, support is equal to base
  * when base is directly above support with direct line to the ground, it becomes a support-base (discriminated)
  * ability to identify the base, and push into it, to help partner to ground more
  * being able to differentiate them, be clear in seeing the differences (in yourself and others)
  * to know where it's possible to pour weight into
* martial arts: often like to lock joints a lot, manipulating the body
  * can be perceived when doing in CI though!
* often difficult to find connection in a duo, even move difficult in trio
* push into partner, into his structure (or counter-pull), to take away weight from the center connection
  * when pushing into partner's structure, consequence: that part will be "glued" into the ground
* no jumping, especially in trio, when one is already being lifted
  * it's rude, disrespectful, but foremost: dangerous!
* beginners: ground + connection, better too much than too little
  * more advanced: lighter, yet center-connected
  * otherwise too heavy/rigid/slow...
* it's about CHOICE: being able to do it, one way or the other
* a good jump (using momentum) has no impact; using it the "right way"
* three layers of skill:
  * 1) vocabulary - techniques  - technical - quantity
  * 2) grammar    - principles  - physical  - quality
  * 3) ?          - attitude    - personal  - essence
  * ad attitutde: patience, listen (receptivity), connection, empathy
    * the mastery of patience: stillness/silence, pause, rest, "wait", to clear the canvas and restart from scratch, creating a total new field of possibilities without the weight of the past)
      * a pause, stillness, moment of nothing (best of something can emerge), blank canvas, allows for complete recreation (shiva)
* "playfulness and effort complement, don't contradict"
* horizontal push/weight = asking for support
  * vertical weight onto = asking for base
  * never move your base away if someone has his weight on it
* movement areas: coresphere - inner sphere - skinesphere - kinesphere - outer sphere
  * be able to perceive all of them; all of them at the same time
  * to not "sink/drown" in the "bubble" when dancing with a partner (like they do in ecstatic dance)
  * stay connected with yourself, the partner, and the "big body" (space, room, other people)
  * enables to be aware if someone wants to join, and decide to say yes/no
* typical beginners mistake: locked legs; stiff, rigid, no steps possible
  * esp. when try to be a base
  * no soft-strong, no relax-ground yet, but overly grounded/heavy
* social dance skills
  * dropping: just ending the dance, leaving it, dropping your partner
  * dumping: politer than dropping, by finding a new partner for your current partner, let him have a continuation (no stop)
  * stealing: find a nice partner in a duette, force yourself into, and "extract" your desired partner (basically "foreign dropping" the third person)
* universal connection technique for proper lifts: "picking up"
  * first push into partner, ensure firm sharing of weight
  * slowly move away, staying in connection, make sure partner still following
  * no gap in-between, glued together
  * transition into lift
  * either standing (push shoulders), or sitting/lying down
  * in short: go in, then out, while staying connected
* like being a "movement architect": sculpting postures of models already shaped out
  * seeing architecture which is established by itself, understanding its structure
* octopus = soft, relaxed /decoration
  * crab = firm, staccatio, more tensed /support
  * know when you need to engage and switch depending when needed (situation/circumstances)
* when flyer is heavy, use "peng jin" of taijiquan: inflated ball quality
* ultimate motto: "breathe, slow down, listen to deepen connection"
* basic skills of a trio participant:
  * knowing where it's possible to give weight (structure, architecture)
  * knowing where support is necessary to give
  * everything also in duette just way more... better...
* EXERCISE: "eye for architecture", in trio
  * 2 dance, 1 rover-satellite
  * rover says "pause", and finds spot to go in-between and support both
  * dancers dance such a way that enough space between; ;more contact from upper shoulders (less lower back)
  * train an eye to find spots where support is needed; with pause, lots of time
  * later necessary skill: see also parent-baby bear exercise
  * requirement to know differences base-support-decoration (where possible to give weight and where is support needed)
* EXERCISE: bear family: 2 parents and baby (instead 2, now 3 people)
  * parents sit next to each other, facing opposite direction
  * baby bear across, first few minutes just soft connecting, static on the spot, little movement (massage like, little swinging)
  * parents constantly base the baby (no changes of roles, although might feel natural)
  * not higher than little animal, safer that way
  * try to maintain connection (glue centers, more diagonally/around the corner, not linear movement, otherwise lose each other, and parent needs to tiptoe/walk around, rapturing/breaking the flow)
  * baby doesn't just fully surrender (like in tantra)
  * it's ok to touch the ground (not lava)
  * parents stay seeking in contact
  * level changes are great, lie down, animal...
* mastery also requires some innate characteristics
  * a calm mind (no ADHD), a personality which is grounded, calm, able for depth, connection, listening; nothing too yang/fiery/bubbly
  * some physical body requirements, some bodies are just not made for it; just like length for basketball professional player
* we solve puzzles; just as in philosophy of science, we don't solve problems but puzzles :)
  * when in a free dance, we encounter things, were regular vocabulary can't be applied just as in artificial laboratory exercises
  * just as karate guys saying: form vs application; one is always same, other must never be the same
* social awkwardness, not feeling comfortable, because of being intimate with another (in duo, and especially in a trio)
  * it prevents a nice dance (keeping distance, pushing away, no connection, limitation in pathways, stiffness)
  * thus first get psychologically comfortable, only then technically can go higher, when trust and safety established, leading to familiarity (family)
* too often, a trio is just a 2+1
  * two doing something (lifting; base+flyer) and third person basically just watching (not safeguarding, not decorating as satellite, disconnected and not integrated/involved)
  * a duette with a spectator, but not a truely three-way interaction
  * same as in sexual area: a true threesome is where everyone is connected with everyone
  * multiplied (not divided) attention; VERY difficult to achieve; not a technique but a quality (of mind)
* how to find a partner, and how to read someone else's skills
  * their space awareness: do they see me, aware of my trajector
  * or do they bump and "neglect my existence"
  * not enjoyable to dance with such people, no listening; they are stuck in their own bubble, ego-centric, potentially dangerous (no presence, no support in case needed); no bad intention, just lack of skill/empathy
* true empathy on the dance floor:
  * "how is it to be you"
  * be aware of what he is aware of
  * space awareness - what are other people in the space aware (or not aware) of
    * what is their level of attention; look at them, figure it out
  * do all this WHILE continuing the dance => multiplied attention
  * physically, keep track of a 3D model of the partner, his whole moving body, put yourself into that model
  * mentally/spiritually: shift the ego identity (usually located behind the eyes) into that person, full self dissolving for a moment (yet stay anchored in yourself while reaching out; some sort of auto-pilot can take over controlling one's own body+perception+movement)
* in trio, there is no 100% attention + connection
  * yes, you WILL be "dropped", being/feeling of abandonment
  * connection will be lost, nothing personal though, but technical necessity
  * regulate your emotion, it's a game (just as life is, a drama/act/theater/laboratory)
  * also: it's not therapy; somewhere else yes, but not in CI
    * mental health is important, and so is reproduction, but not during a CI class/on the dance floor
* social skill as a duett, inviting a third person
  * reaching with arms, mirror/imitate/sync movements
  * look&smile always works, but less sophisticated/elegant solution
* social "bumps", when 2 rovers want to join the same duo
  * leading to a competition? who gets it... or simply solve by going into a quartette.
* when approach: better take more/too much time than too little
* CI exists in a very specific domain
  * thus, it needs a very specific vocabulary; required to come up with/invent new jargon/words, special terms
  * unique, or at least unique in meaning
  * this makes it exclusive (bad), and also more precise+efficient (good)
* what is your intention to join?
  * is it because you want to add something, or do you want to take something
  * if it's already "complete", could maximum maybe decorate/support, but don't join in, as it would destroy what's already perfect
  * they will come to you, when acting as a satellite, if they are aware+want you to join them
  * same with love: do you love the sensation you get (when being with that person; selfishly), or do you love the object of love (person) itself (selflessly)
    * do you like doing CI because the feeling it gives you, or do you do it for "it"?
* moving/decorating in negative space has also function to be of support when required
  * if partner falls, immediately you are there; contact is made/bridge is built to support/push/leverage
  * esp. when going down to the floor
  * definition of a "satellite":outside of reach for contact; outside kinesphere; approx. 1-2m away
  * but still engaged with, synchronized with others (not just standing still, crossed arms)
* highest (jedi) skill, having proprioceptive awareness into the other person's body
  * don't even need to look (could have eyes closed), and know where they are positioned
  * think of touching your nose when eyes closed, but know the other person's nose while he is moving
  * try to "helmet" the other person; constantly keeping unconsciously track of positioning
* attention can't be multiplied; some claim
  * but it's like pseudo parallelism in single-core CPU computer architecture
  * very quick switching/alternating, faking parallelism, paying attention to in&out at the "same time"
* EXERCISE: 1 eyes closed, 1 eyes open, 1 satellite
  * closed eyes: totally goes inwards, more feeling, more fuzzy everything
    * too much in the body, requires being more in the head (thinking/mental)
  * open eyes: being in the middle of both extremes on the continuum
  * satellite: totally outwards, attention on, thinking mode; not sensing, not dancing usually
    * too much looking, needs more sensing/feeling
  * goal: be inwards while satellite, be outwards while eyes closed
  * e.g., when joining as a satellite, emphasize kinesthetic resonance (mirror/imitate)
  * same as guardian angel: sync yourself, instead standing still
  * when mirroring, do it without looking => jedi skill of unconscious processing
  * like snipers do, predicting position in very next moment
* social skill: space awareness in trios
  * look outside while feel inside, to spot whether there is a "more attractive couple" somewhere
  * pay attention (sensitivity) + think and judge
  * gently/elegantly disengage and move there
* what's worse then lack of skill => unawareness of lack of skill
  * or even worse worse (similar to dunning kruger effect): believing that good, but actually bad, and resisting feedback when being told that bad
  * also with general qualities:
    * some people think they are slow, but are actually super fast, and don't like to be told so
* many women use images to verbalize; some of them confuse models with reality (down to superstitions)
  * e.g. talking about "feeling" and "sensing energy", not knowing about complexity of reality
  * confusing sensation with reality
  * creating simplified, childish stories themselves and clamining that's absolute, objective truth
* nicest skill ever: if partner can predict pathways, and be there, support, being at right place at the right time
* when too fast, maybe fun, wild, chaos, feminine
  * but no precision, control, quality
  * just fooling around doing something, but doing nothing really
