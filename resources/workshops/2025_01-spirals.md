WORKSHOP "mystery & mastery of spirals"; tom goldhand, 3.-5. january 2025

Spiral is one of the key aspects in Contact Improvisation and in movement in general, it can be found in any living being – from our double helix DNA, to the galaxy's shape, to our patterns, movement’s formation and structural building.

In this workshop we will learn to harness this structure, to better understand it and to build with it a stronger, more fluid way of movement. We will discover new hidden pathways that lay dormant in our body, that once opens will transform our dance into higher levels.
 
Spirals are one of the strongest movement forms in our body and it allows us to grow from the center outward and from the ground up. Spirals are the way upward from the ground into the sky – so lets Spiral our way to heaven.


Pre-Homework - define SPIRALS
=============================================
- a spiral is a curve which emanates from a point; moving further away, revolving around that point

THEORETICAL - LINGUISTICS
---------------------------------------------
- adjective definitions:
    * winding around a center/pole + gradually receding-from/approaching-it
    * of or relating to the advancement to higher levels through a series of cyclical movements
    * synonyms: coiling, helical, winding, involute, corkscrew, screwlike
- noun defintions:
    * 1a) the path of a point in a plane moving around a central point while continuously receding from or approaching it
    * 1b) a three-dimensional curve (such as a helix) with one or more turns about an axis
    * 2) a single turn or coil in a spiral object
    * 3) something having a spiral form as: spiral galaxy, spiral flight, football rotating its long axis; continuously spreading/accelerting increase/decrease (wage spirals)
- verb definitions:
    * spiraled or spiralled; spiraling or spiralling
    * intransitive verb: to go and especially to rise/fall in a spiral course costs spiraled upward
    * transitive verb: to form into a spiral; to cause to spiral
    * synonyms: coil, entwine, wind, corkscrew, twine, curl, twist
- broader definitions:
    * a curve on a plane that winds around a fixed center point at a continuously increasing/decreasing distance from the point
    * a three-dimensional curve that turns around an axis at a constant/continuously varying distance while moving parallel to the axis; a helix.
    * a curve winding around a central point; progressively closer/further away from the center; like a coil or helix
* synonymes/related words:
  * EN: spiral, helical/helix, scroll(=snail)-shaped, loop, wind, twine, winch, wreathe, wrest, wrench
  * DE: spirale, spirealfoermig, spiralig, (hoch-)winden, Wendel, schneckenfoermig, Spule, klettern
* similar yet different words (in movements, shapes)
  * spin: rotating rapidly; whirl; often around an axis
  * turn: change direction/orientation; a single movement (e.g., turning a corner) or a complete change in direction
  * rotate: spinning around a central axis; maintaining orientation relative to the axis; e.g., Earth rotating on its axis
  * twist: turning/bending something in a circular motion; to wind/coil (rope) about something; like a tornado, a twister
  * helix: distance to axis (r) stays constant, opposed to increasing/decreasing for spirals
  * vertex: TODO
  * funnel: TODO

THEORETICAL - GEOMETRICAL
---------------------------------------------
- math: a curve emanating from a point; moving further away as it revolves around the point
- 2D/plane spiral: a curve on a plane that winds around a fixed center point at a continuously increasing/decreasing distance from the point
  - easily described with polar coordinates
- 3D/space spiral: a curve that turns around an axis at a constant/continuously varying distance while moving parallel to the axis; a helix
  - e.g.: conical spirals (triangle), spherical spirals (ball), toroidal spirals; double-twisted helix (a spiral wound around a helix)
- different types: Archimedean spiral (like a nautilus shall on 2D), a helix (like staircase or ramps for bikes/cars), and a conical spiral (like a pyramide but circular and spiraling)
- helix: A helix (pl. helices) is a shape like a cylindrical coil spring or the thread of a machine screw
    * a type of smooth space curve with tangent lines at a constant angle to a fixed axis
    * see DNA molecule (two intertwined helices)
    * Greek word: "twisted, curved"
    * a "filled-in" helix (for example a "spiral" (helical) ramp) is a surface called a helicoid
        - helicoid ("helical surface"): a smooth surface embedded in three-dimensional space; traced by an infinite line that is simultaneously being rotated and lifted along its fixed axis of rotation
          => see: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Helicoid.svg
    * a conic spiral (conic helix): a spiral on a conic surface, distance to apex an exponential function of the angle indicating direction from the axis
    * see helix composed of 2 sinus curves: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix#/media/File:Rising_circular.gif
- a subtype of whorled patterns: a group also including concentric objects
    - whorl = whirling, coiling; curl, swirl (wirbel); arising from a single point (on an axis)
      - a whorl is spiral patterns occuring in plants/animals (e.g. sunflower head)
      - a whorl is also called the spirally pattern of fingerprints
    - an individual circle/oval/volution, in a whorled pattern; consisting of a spiral / multiple concentric objects
    - examples:
        * like leaves or branches, radiating from a single point
        * the whorl of a fingerprint (central paipllary ridges turn through at least one complete circle)
        * hair whorl: patch of hair growing in circula rdirection around a visible center point (head, beart, chest)
        * see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whorl#/media/File:Whorls.png
- nautilus shell, a logarithmic spiral
  - formed by rotating a closed curve around a fixed axis
  - "golden spiral" using the golden ratio of 1:1.618 as a growth factor
  - 137.5 degrees is the golden angle, related to golden ratio
  - also: fractal pattern; fibonacci spiral

PHILOSOPHICAL TECHNICAL
---------------------------------------------
* if we narrow the word spiral in the context of movement, it still needs to be defined whether we talk about:
  * shape, a funnel like shape, as in: sitting down, arms close to the shoulders, slowly standing up in a rotational manner, slowly spreading the arms further away, like a helicopter (=helix, but moving along the axis) but increasing distance r
  * or some development of kinetic force (spring quality)
  * or some higher level of abstraction of movement pattern
* spiral movement (actually helix) is an emergent property, from a reductionist point of view, there's only rotation (anatomically seen)
  * just like that there is "actually" no push or pull movement, but only contraction of muscle fibers
    * there is no god, no state, no company, no money,... imagined realities
    * there is no wetness or heat, it's also just an emergent property (if you look closely, you won't find it)
    * consciousness as an emergent property?!
  * if a spiral is a delay of rotation in segmented parts, then a stiff (solid, unanimated object) can't spiral but only rotate
    * if we zoom in closely, there are no solid object, as in the atomar level there will always be a delay, thus everything spirals (everything is wobbly)
    * going further, we could argue there are no distinct objects... and we are down the rabbit hole ;)
  * what can be considered as a true fact depends on the level of magnification; before discussing, it needs to be agreed which level we are talking about
    * like the story with the elefant and the blind people...
    * for us humans, to talk in human practical terms, we should preferably by default assume the human perception of reality (although just an abstraction/illusion, yet the one we all share and live in)
  * it's like classical mechanics is still a useful tool (like language is, words, constructs, abstractions of but not reality itself) although quantum mechanics invalidated it (the distortion of the quantum realm is neglectable to still yield useful results of classical mechanics)
* having that said:
  * lowest useful level of magnification to go would be molecular level: muscle contraction (myosin-actin interaction and the sliding filament theory)
  * based on that, there are, due to bio-mechanics (muscles, tendons, joints working together), the basic movements of our body/anatomy: flex/ext., ab/adduction, int/ext rotation, elev/depr, protr/retra, and few more
  * based on that, more complex movement patterns can emerge, such as spirals

ANATOMY, BIO-MECHANICS, PHYSICS
---------------------------------------------
- myofascial chains; working as a unit; according to our anatomy: in spirals
- physics: rotation, angular momentum, ...
- "spiral lines" on the body: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPpdR1r9k7E
  - crossed 2x: 1) between shoulderblades and 2) at the naval
  - left spiral line includes right shoulder+rib cage, and then to left hip and leg, around heel and up again to head (and vice versa
  - from head, over splenii muscles, to rhomboids (through medial border of scapula; a reciprocal relation) to serratus interior...
- (oblique = diagonal)

PRACTICAL - MOVEMENT
---------------------------------------------
- cross-lateral necessary; diagonals
- rotation (initiated by center, moving as a whole; vs from externals/limbs/fingers/toes, sequential)
- geometric shape; polymorph like "wave-particle thing": from side a rectangle, from top a circle
- "carving space"
- transverse spiraling: a change in 3 unequal spatial pulls
    - spatial pull: invisible line of inherent power (potential energy), can be revealed in movement (crystalline forms, like icosahedron, provide a roadmap for spatial pulls)
* we can spiral inwards (towards center) or outwards (expansion)
* different axis possible:
  * also: single VS multiple at the same time
  * whereas: a spiral is a movement in all 3 planes; if only 1 plane, that it isn't a spiral
* coordination of complex movement patterns (like multiple spirals in different axis throughout the whole body):
  * too much to comprehend consciously intellectually anymore; we need to rely (backoff) to images (that's why flowery language used); easier to use the body/move with an image, than anatomical precise instructions

PERSONAL - ASSOCIATIONS
---------------------------------------------
* rectangle-circle duality (like "wave–particle duality") of spirals:
  * from the side, it looks like a rectangle, from the top like a circle
  * tantric wisdom: if we look "from the top" on our behavior, it seems like we are going in circles, doing the same mistakes over and over again. but looking from the side, there is actually change (hopefully improvements) happening. doing the same mistakes, yes, but with less impact, more mindful, with shorter delays in getting back awareness in the moment.
  * spiralsymbol for spiritual purification:
    * Christianity, neo-Platonist symbol for prayer/contemplation, circling around a subject and ascending at the same time
    * Buddhist symbol for gradual process on Path to Enlightenment
    * while a helix is repetitive, a spiral expands and thus epitomizes growth - conceptually ad infinitum.
* in math as an alternative coordinate system (cartesian vs polar)
* common "spiral objects":
  * a spring (a helix though, not a spiral)
  * "spiral" for contraception
  * a funnel (getting smaller and smaller, faster and faster in a circle-like line)
  * a shell (nautilus, snail)
  * a screw; a simple rotation, yet also moving downards; drilling into; or other mechanical gears
  * stairs (wendeltreppe); fire escape outside of buildings in movies
  * a (metal) spring to allow its expanding force
  * phone cable (back in the good old days, stationary landline phones)
  * the tail of some lizard-like animals
  * galaxies (discs)
  * the edges of a notebook
* in cartoons, when eyes are replaced with spiral objects to indicate that they are dizzy/hypnotized
  * when wanting to hypnotize someone, they have to look at a rotating spiral pattern (kaa, jungle book)

PERSONAL - IN MY SURROUNDINGS
---------------------------------------------
* a biro, it uses a spring to "push out"; similar the mechanism of a  (pin tumbler) lock (key pushing pins in vertical shafts)
* a sink, like a funnel, water moving in spiral shape (drainspin); and no, direction independent of hemisphere ;)
* my hair (beart and chest) has a spiral pattern :)
* mental sensations (thoughts and emotions) can have a "spiral nature", as such that it has almost an irresistible gravitational pull down towards its center

PERSONAL - IN MY MOVEMENT
---------------------------------------------
* we don't spiral the arm, we rotating it (no change towards/away from center)
* usually body's center line used as the axis, and arms/hands as the force initiator
* use of centrifugal force: throwing arm peripherally away to spin the center (ice-skater like)
* used to get up/down to preserve kinetic energy (momentum); more efficient
  * instead of using a straight line (simply going up/down) with more effort
  * see feldenkrais sit-stand spiral transition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-xG60F_qVg
* locally in hand, leading with fingers, rotating in wrist; drawing a spiral with constant distance to axis

TAIJI
---------------------------------------------
* taiji/qigong/martial arts all about it; using how muscles are built; using kinetic principle to deflect incoming force
* rotation of a punch when hitting, but also defensive deflective techniques
* same as we propagate throwing baseball in a full body spiral; also using fa-jing quality
* see spirals of chen taiji: https://practicalmethod.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3-27-2014-1-31-09-PM.jpg
  * going throw major joints; spiral structures allow to return incoming force outward (drill bits extracting material upward as drill inward)
  * "to withdraw is to issue" (issue=push out)
  * everything is rotation! (no up/down, left/right, in/out); see silk-reeling exercise
* taiji uses "contained spiral force" (instead of bare "momentum" as so many do, which can easily be overcome; the weak overcoming the strong); it's like a tire spinning in the air, while on its axis of the car (you touch it, you burn yourself), compared to when it is rolling on its own on the ground (you touch it, you can stop it slowly); that's how the force in taiji is contained
* a spiral in taiji is: A rotation on the body while another part of the body stretches it.


DAY 1
=============================================

* the complementary pattern/force to spirals are waves. different, simpler.
  * even "better": to combine both of them at the same time
* dancing (CI) is like sex:
  * most people are self-centered, focus on themselves, not really listening, like "using the other's body to masturbate themselves"
    * or as in communication: most of the them there are 2 parallel monologues, no one is listening; rarely there are true dialogues happening, no mutual exchange;
  * most dominant (men) immediately penetrate, without preparation/foreplay/warm-up, without consent. they dominate, control, manipulate; egoistically; would need some negative space dance before; like dog's ass sniffing; get to know each other, calibrate/adjust to each other
    * our society's "hook-up mentality" is superficial, into quick pleasures (hedonistic; good is what feels good; always be happy); it takes a lot of time to get to know each other properly first
  * some people have no clue, they do weird stuff because they just don't know
  * real depth, for advanced, is slow and subtle
  * oldschool CI = survive, catching, saving oneself, playing, after losing balance (chaos, primal); these people were all young, strong, very advanced and experienced people; professionals, decades of training; we are just amateurs; don't try to imitate those out of your league or you will fall on your nose (or worse; throw your partner on his nose)
    * more "modern" approach: more fluid, flowy; more safe, and gentle, deep.
* group exercise; definition:
  * define (and describe how it looks): spiral, turn
    * where does a spiral start from/end? can it form the center/axis?
  * a turn is linear, a spiral circular
    * turn has a fixed point, clear direction
    * spiral is spinning infinitely
  * turn: rotation as a whole; spiral: sequential rotation
  * drawing: a spiral on 2D plane; looking from the side, like a pyramide (also upside down)
    * a helix: just a circle in 2D, but from the side a rectangle (like wave-particle duality)
  * a spiral has to do with elasticity (like a vortex, you spin a cross, when it's elastic, it will bend quicker closer to center, and later on the outside)
  * a car turns, but doesn't spiral; very simple change direction
  * turn: has no initiation point, all points move at the same time (practically speaking)
  * spiral: starts from initiation point, and grows with a delay towards the end
    * a spiral has a delay; subsequent rotations of the joints; like a wave travelling through the body
  * turn: homolateral, spiral: contra (cross) lateral (crossing axis/some plane)
* be aware of axis (and planes)
* walking is a primed spiral (like a spring force); not a complex spiral, and we "break it" when we walk, left/right motion
* it is underestimated the importance of "shadow-movements", unconscious little adjustments (in the shadow), e.g. to (re)balance quickly; look at the big toe of a person for example
* learning by observation; a lot possible
* notation system for CI doesn't exist; nothing tailored to its needs. laban's notion system not sufficient, not capable of capturing the specific qualities of CI
* EXERCISE: 2 couples, 1 free dancing (try flowy, spirally, round, circle; or just be yourself, be authentic); other couple drawing what they see; follow a specific body part, the change that part to another
  * possibile for example: upper part of paper draw head, then below shoulder, etc... in segments
* being able to see A) weight B) center C) spirals; know where to put weight (architecture)
  * being able to anticipate next movement; safer, better (requires pathway continuation)
* under-emphasized skill: be a support in the right moment, anticipate, predict, be there and push into
* as an intermediate, using strength to pull someone (acrobatics like), but not a lift, no technique (yet)
* much of skill is "hidden" if mistrust, fear... maybe person itself, maybe inter-personal caused.
* "good dancers start slow" (with people they know, you can also have fast quickies)
* the way we talk is the way we dance, both an expression of personality
  * personality: stable traits, yet with age (periods of life), they change (sturm und drang of the young; calmness of the older), within the same person; thus: how stable is it really?
* most people are afraid of depth, of intimacy, of deep intimacy; going slow, feeling and connecting with each other; going fast is a way to avoid that quality; running (away). fast makes us not feel what's happening; unaware.
* EXERISE: barrel extended:
  * segment lower and upper body, to transition from turn to spiral
  * keep contact in 1) head 2) shoulder 3) pelvis
* essential CI (part of its definition)
  * being improvised, empty mind, not wanting, let it happen in the moment
  * BUT: we anticipate 0.5 seconds ahead
  * difference aware in the moment ahead VS forcing my plans other(s)
* "to be in the head" is required, a good thing, paying attention to what's happening
  * 1) be of support when & where my partner needs it
  * 2) be aware of architecture/center/grounding of my partner
  * it's a continuous interplay of A) conscioius/deliberate/intellectual/analytical and B) unconscious/felt/sensed/intuitive/visceral process of information to respond to through movement
* technique (posture/alignmen, weight/leverage) compensates for strenght, yet some moves require strength
* precision in movement = high resolution body awareness
  * being fast lowers resolution
* EXERCISE: starfish spiral extended
  * start form one body part, partner says "pause", touches another body part, and then cotniue to initiate the spiral from there
  * start with easy points, then go to more difficult like on bone between joints; use intention as technically not possible to do
* many esoteric-metaphysical-magical "energy" approaches are not easy to understand, their explanations mystical, and that's exactly what makes them so attractive. they seem advanced (because complicated/not understandable). the serve some romantic need (like any superstition does)

DAY 2
===============
* "we hire attitude, not skill"
  * a good dances is based on an attitude of patience, mutual listening, collaboration, and seize opportunities when they arise. it's not so much about how high and quick someone can be lifted (usually by grabbing and using muscular force). this might look intimidating to the untrained eye, but is shallow and lacks depth.
  * skill can be learned quickly, the right attitude takes a life long of practice
* priming spirals (vs continuous spirals): abruptly stoping it, changing the direction
  * when we walk, we prime spirals; when we lift as a base
  * like charging a spring (quality): down, charge up, release, up (explosively)
* pathway continuation possibilities expand when spirals can shift in planes
  * when first going into one direction (plane) spiraling, and then wanting to change direction into other, smoothly transition by overlapping into another plane (turning it for a moment into a more complex spiral pattern)
  * also possible to change the body parts leading
  * if it stays a simple spiral, then it feels boring and can get stuck
* EXERCISE: stand, rotate form different body parts
  * have relaxed arms (slapping oneself, like in gigong)
  * 1) solo: learn to differentiate better by leading from different parts: { feet, ankles, knees, hips, chest, shoulders, head }
  * 2) with a partner: he tells you where to move from
  * 3) partner tries to guess from which partner you are moving from
* when changing direction + maintain pathway, use a different plane, choose a body part, incorporate spirals
* EXERCISE in lanes: tell partner
  * 1: { up, down, change direction }
  * 2: + kinesphere size changes { small, big }
* magnetization: an alternate pattern to rolling point of contact
  * it allows new spiral pathways if used correctly
  * magentize the backs, attached to each other; find a common axis between both bodies and pivot around it
  * stop and change direction of spirals, enables new possibilities; e.g. to lift back2back
* in some exercises, to make it easier, have a dedicated leader-follower role
* to dare to push into your partner, don't be afraid to be rude or anything like it; it allows many new different possibilities
  * it can actually feel very comfortable/supportive, to be pushed, to be lead/dominated, even the head (know with whom though!)
* what's the difference between "forcing it" and "making use of possibilities/opportunities", realizing potential?! when do we cross that line of following a preset plan, and when are we allowing things to emerge by itself? it is not fully passive, it is seeing, realizing, and actively doing (but what's there, not fully generated by oneself).
* physics: the difference between power/energy/force seems not really clear. same as CoG/CoM, maybe shared center as well...
* EXERCISE: sit next to each other, papa bear like, roll over; head down and butt up
  * roll between legs, partner assists with arms/hands to roll over to other side
  * variation: move over with outer leg first (over partner's further away leg); while doing so, turning, rolling on the belly, the outer arm spirals underneath your own body
    * ending up in a little animal position and then up (or directly into a hiplift)

* dealing with the unexpected (a fall) in a controlled (safe) and energy efficient way
  * using what's there, as a (not only source of inspiration (creativity, improvisation) but) also as an "engine", a driving force
  * like in taijiquan, continuing the pathway, as a slingshot and adding one's own force to it, instead of resisting it (pushing against it)
  * saying "yes, and..." as done in improvisation acting; embracing of what is, whatever there is, even though you might dislike it
* in strong positions (when scared?) engaging the core is crucial, yet breathing often stops with it
  * solution: use the "pilates breath", you might not like it at first, but it has its use: inflate the chest, keeping the belly tight (no belly breathing), abs contracted
  * dedicate some time to deliberately practice and pay attention to the breathing styles; esp. in effortful moves/movements (in scary ones anyway to keep on breathing, secondary which technique being used as long as keep on breathing to regulate nervous system/fear response/emotions)
* when a new movement (and also generally, anything new in life) feels weird, it might be because it is indeed weird, or: it's "because of you" ;) most likely it hasn't habituated yet (or just not compatible?!)
  * it's like learning to drive a car: first effortful ("i'm in my head"), later driving while talking, eating, and can't even remember how you got home (automated/autopilot)
  * e.g. when learning new movement pathway, then the focus is on what's usually unnoticed, it draws/requires so much attention that no focus left for the dance/partner => push through, just at the beginning 
* recursive patterns, like in telecommunication a carrier wave containing multiple streams of information on different frequencies (at the same time, co-existing)
  * same with body "waves", or spirals in that case
  * theoretically infinite recursions possible, infinitely combinable, yet practically already 2 recursions are very difficult/complex to execute
  * try maintaining 1 big spiral, while adding another "into it" at a different frequency (or plane for that matter)
* play with dimensions, deliberately explore the edges of: slow-fast, follow-lead, soft-hard (push), relaxed-tensed, ... check how your partner responses, what works, what doesn't
* manipulate the other, dare to "grab/push/direct" even the leg or the head, more like "give impulses" 
* some of the more difficult moves (acrobatics?!) require not only technical skill, but also strength and especially a strong sense of balance
* breaking the pattern usually doesn't feel nice, not about hedonistic pleasure (happy/fun), but about growth ("earned pleasure" will come by itself, due to a natural process, not laziness)
* eyes tell a story: into space (not down onto the ground), open and receptive (not dreamy, bleary)
  * even more advanced: look up, while flying
* EXERCISE (old/known one): partner stands, other touches 2 points, try to connect them with a spiral (choose which point start/end, which axis to connect; yes, an axis can be curved)
  * start very simple, easy; transition into more difficult ones (e.g. head, very close to each other points (on long bones))
  * sometimes just work with intention for the impossible ones
* talking about lines and points: the theoretical (geometrical/mathematical) realm is an abstraction of reality, not reality itself; any concept, such as metaphysical "energies" and other superstitions are likewise; don't confuse the finger (which is pointing to the moon) with the moon, don't climb up the sign and claim to have been there; don't confuse money with wealth, and the word with meaning; practical, yet not real
* center connection, like in real life:
  * A) we haven't found/connected it even to our own center, thus nothing to be connected to
  * B) fear of intimacy (in-to-me-see), deep connection, being seen, truly; see the other's pain/suffering (can i hold space for that?) and feeling vulnerable (esp. man-man)
  * C) we go to fast to let things sink, to reach the depth necessary for a real connection
  * D) our modus operandi is to stay superficial, all society/environment tought us/habituated us to
* EXERCISE: rotate extended arms in counter-directions (start both up, each going other direction)
  * do it with a partner, correct each other
  * CONT: do it while walking, and then also sharp 180 degrees turn
* Learning a new skill requires a sophisticated, well thought through methodological approach, adapted to one's own, individual needs how one's brain likes to learn best (do you know?)
  * "just doing it" will be frustrating, or just not fruitful
  * structured/analytical, divide and conquer, slow; acknowledging one's own level (dunning kruger effect)
* daoistic principle (ziran=of its own, by itself): let it organically happen, do not interfere with a natural process; momentum, gravity, joints, biomechanics. a lift and drop of the arm, has its own path, let it do its thing
  * "do nothing, and all will be done"
  * zen/iaido the same: mushin = empty mind. you want, you will fail. no intention, not even "not having an intention"-intention
  * coordinative exercises like rotating arms will not even only be easy, but absolutely effortless. to fail is actually effortful as the interference requires effort: "how is it possible to not being able to do that?!" you then wonder
* let the spiral-momentum guide/dictate the pathway. not interfering with "wanting" (thus muscular force)
* EXERCISE: how to change direction?
  * while drawing a circle on a 2D plane: necessary to go out of the kinesphere, by drawing an eight
    * draw lines in a spherical space without breaking the pathway
  * in 3D space, change -temporarily- the plane
  * instead of using single finger, draw circles/spirals with full hand
* verify it's working (application/applied test): with partner, stay in connection (!) while changing direction (also do it fast, and be precise)
* "it's all about (conscious) choice"; if it's not a choice, it's not free. going fast-slow, up-down, holding or not, ... being able to be on each edge of the range of each dimension, not out of necessity (because nothing else is possible), but because of a deliberate, conscious, educated, thought through decision (most beneficial option in this context)
* head movement: can be a nice spice, but don't do it constantly
  * enhanced if first led by the eyes, and when reaching also with the fingers "beyond"
  * think of rotations/spirals: if eyes/head stay static, rest of the body won't follow
  * try a backflip while the chin is to the chest -impossible!
* dare to give yourself the fear of "being too much"; this is what makes it alive, giving weight
  * same of dancing to deliberately push/manipulate the partner
* priming spiral - charging a spring. using kinetic energy, stored in one direction, and (explosively/rapidly) released in the other
* ass, titties, penises... it's just tissue. it's not a thing, as long as you don't create a story around it
* EXERCISE: one lies down, on the back, partner manipulates the head, receiver uses the manipulation and moves from there. first lying, the mid-level, then stand up
  * switch to holding shoulders, guide hands, etc.
  * give gentle, constant changes/inputs to maintain spiral patterns; it's more like a suggestion
  * CONT: instead using hand/arms to manipulate, join with the whole body; from time 2 time use hands again to give impulses
  * do it all slowly, and be precise; listen carefully to partner's input
  * CONT: free dance, but give hints/impulses to your partner; free roles now, both can give impulses
    * not only with hand, but with feet, legs, shoulder, ... on different parts, box, arms, head, knees
* beginner's lift: grabbing, forcing it, artificial; advanced's: it happens, through sharing weight, passive for the flyer, and most importantly: no use of arms/hands (using them, and chicken wings, is usually cheating, and a sign of not properly balanced/cnetered)
* when leading, and follower experiences hick ups, it's usually the leader's insecurity/lack of confidence what makes the follower experience that -in short: it's always the leaders fault ;)
* neijia, the internal martial arts (incl. russian systema): experts in sensitivity to incoming force, and yielding to it; very soft...
* for advanced/experienced/seasoned practitioner: shu-ha-ri
  * break pathways; grab with hand; manipulate (with hand, leg); target of manipulation: head, neck, center, knees, ...
* EXERCISE: stand with partner side-by-side, both have their arms up to "zip" along the side, with lots of oomph-quality
  * one goes straight down to lil animal (inner leg bends knee first, backwards step)
  * other spirals "away", through the backside, and landing on the side on the lil animal (watch out not falling off the butt)
  * important: keep the centers together (use chicken weg to keep connected if necessary)
* filling space like water, daoism:
  * dare to fall, more than sharing weight, more advanced
  * no conscious decision, no delay, but also no resistance when being pushed away
  * "always trust your partner, and trust yourself more", meaning: being able to catch yourself if necessary, yet fully surrender with a full into your partner
* EXERCISE: walk side-by-side, one goes down, little animal, flyer goes over: leg first, on back (don't jump as a flyer on the base, use a push of the arms instead and roll slowly over); always find balance point, have a check point (see CI wiki for exercise instructional video/description)
* EXERCISE: 1) solo, arms in "priming spiral" mode, rotating around, left-right, change levels, arms pointing down, mid, and up (esp. traversing shoulder level is tricky for many); while doing so, also rotate torso/pelvis (movement shows up e.g. when shoulder lifting a flyer)
  * CONT: walk around while doing this
  * CONT: B) draw spirals with fingers on axis outside the body, then move the axis inside the body
  * CONT: combine A+B (plus the "swinging arms" from before)
* shoulder lift:
  * flyer has arm on further away partner's shoulder (other at beginning just freely); base has around back, below flyer's, other arm ready to reach under, stand very wide 
  * base doing a "priming spiral" move (charging the spring); if needed (and possible strength wise) go lower so flyer doesn't have to jump that high
  * flyer stays very close to base's center, rolling "upwards" (defying gravity), staying in (rolling point of) contact, and kicks over and way back-behind the base's shoulder (do koala before, if don't feel confident yet)
  * flyer needs to spiral early to land on the side (closer to center line, easier), otherwise on belly (watch out for penis-squeeze), watch out for rolling over flyer's neck (you don't want to break it!)
  * once up, extend abducted legs and arms (here could do a "propeller"); stay for a moment to verify balance
  * flyer can use chicken wing while going down (bend elbow, hand up; no interlocking!!! also not with ext. arm)
  * slide down to the back, good gorilla; stay for a moment, verify balance
  * going down and continue spirals/rolling point of contact
* new techniques learned at the beginning feel very mechanical, edgy, "straight line", separated, artificial... not yet embodied so that they can naturally flow into the dance. e.g.: hiplift, while standing, up, down, and then only start to move again, instead of continuously moving
