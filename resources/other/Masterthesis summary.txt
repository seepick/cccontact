CI by ariane.

* CI pioneer Stark Smith

----

* it's a contemporary dance form; worldwide social dance form
* partnered improvisational dance; no set moves but high awareness of communication through movement/touch/sharing weight; exploration of mutual physical cooperation
* fundamental movement patterns: yielding, pushing, reaching, pulling, releasing
* physical forces: gravity, momentum, falling, balancing (all while keeping contact)
* non-verbal communication of where/how to move
* psychologically: stress relief, relaxation, well-being, happiness, joy, connectedness, empowerment, feel more fearless; clearer experienced "sense of self" (being aware of one's own existence) and the body
* mindfulness, as attentions is attracted to "shared zones of contact/touch" brings us to the present moment (not on stressful thoughts); stress-free as: no intention to reach a goal, just exploring movement/touch itself
	- requires to be attentive, aware, present
* touch (tactile experience): soft to slide, or deep to the bones; a nonverbal, two-way dialogue process, form of communication
	- touch reduces stress (lowered cortisol levels; biomarker for stress-related diseases); increase oxytocin (attachment, connectedness); lower blood pressure
	- touch important during developmental phase of a human; also later (developing sexuality; communicating friendship)
	- touch deprivation => depression, body image, self-esteem, aggression, self-injurious behaviors (also good for lonely/isolated, which is for many mental disorders)
	- touch releases endogenous opioids (relax, fell good, be more resilient)
	- in UK, 54% (of 40k participants) want more touch in their lives!
	- we live in a low-touch society :( mistrusting strangers by default.
* physiologically: nerve fibers in skin (CT/c-tactile afferents), activated through gentle/slow stroking with body-like temperature
	- warmth => serotonin/"happiness hormone", emotional regulation; also sympathy and interpersonal affection
	- cold: when being socially excluded skin temperature decreases
	- CT afferents: activate insular brain region, which is for interoception (perceive current bodystate, facilitating sense of self)
	- skin touch: connection extra-personal stimulation and intra-personal world
* massage effect of "sharing weight"
	- good against anxiety/depression/ADHD, ASD, eating disorders (better sense of own body)/autoimmune diseases/MS/chronic fatigue syndrome/...
	- activation of parasympathetic nervous system
* relate to others; strong social connections
	* giving and receiving support (sharing weight); physically and emotionally; trust, safety; presenting vulnerabilities/instabilities; intimacy
* experience during dance: playfulness, surprises, curiosity, flow state, feeling free, being alive; vitality, nourished, energized; connectedness: trust, closeness, deep communication, safe, secure
	- connectedness = one being (not clear who gave impulse = "third entity" according to Paxton); "feeling more home in my own body" sensation; by feeling you, i feel the boundary, thus i feel myself more
	- negative ones as well: bored, insecure/doubts, exhaustion, strenuous, be at one's own mercy
* personality strengthening: more aware of one's own needs, distinguish oneself from others
	- break patterns; resilience-building impact
* touch need to happen with consent, wanting to touch and wanting to be touched; respect boundaries; must be possible to step out of touch at any given moment
	- CI facilitator needs to address those things
	- practicing a "no" by exercises, or introducing "safety rules" at CI events
	- gender-based groups? sharing circles (share personal experiences in a safe space and reflect upon)?
	- some people might feel overwhelmed by touch; depending on personality traits and trust in others (pleasant experience or not)
* CI is not only for the young (well-trained people); no requirement for acrobatic performance
	- the body needs to be mobile, bones can bear weight
