ideas for a workshop about waves (in contrast to spirals)

PHYSICS
================================================================================================================
* Wave Motion = transferring energy/pressure/momentum from A to B
  * no matter transferred between A and B
  * a medium (solid/liquid/gas/vacuum) is required to do so
  * examples: sound (pressure gradient), light (electromagnetic), ocean, seismic (mechanical), microwaves
* grouping:
  * classification:
    * propagation medium:
      * mechanical: not in vacuum; longitudinal/transverse/surface
      * electromagnetic (=non-mechanical): no medium required for propagation (there is no "ether"); radio/micro/infrared/visible light/ultraviolet/X-ray/gamma
      * matter
    * motion of wave in space
    * transfer of energy:
      * progressive/travelling: travel continuously (same direction)
      * stationary: appear stationary, as two waves (same amplitude/wavelength) travel in the opposite direction, colliding
  * dimensionality:
    * one: on a line, like a string
    * two: on a plane, like a ripple in water
    * three: in space, like light/sound waves
  * other type classifications: (non-)periodic, transverse, longitudinal, surface, body, continuous, discrete, (non-)linear
* characteristics:
  * amplitude: maximum displacement, wave size 
  * period: how long it takes for a point to complete one vibration/oscillation (inverse proportional to frequency)
  * wavelength: length between two consecutive compressions or rarefactions
  * frequency: vibrations per second (in hertz)
  * velocity: distance travelled per second
* terminology:
  * reflection: light traveling through two different media, bouncing off the boundary, changing direction
  * refraction: sound/water/light waves changing media, thus changing direction/speed, bending it
  * doppler effect: motion-related frequency change (sound and electromagnetic waves); pitch difference when ambulance passes; calculation of age of universe by red-shift
  * intensity: energy carried (watts), proportional to amplitude
  * polarization: orientation of oscillations
  * interference: multiple waves meet; superposition of wave patterns, waves combine forming a resultant wave (constructive or destructive)
  * angular frequency: rate change in rotation happens; change in sinusoidal wave; angular displacement per time unit
  * time/phase/path difference
* oscillation: repeating vibrations (latin: to swing); a force pushing/pulling back toward central point after displacement

GENERAL MOVEMENT
================================================================================================================
* undulatory locomotion: wave-like movement pattern, to propel an animal forward (snakes, salamander)
  * means of self-propulsion relying of generation/propagation of waves along a body
  * "rostral to caudal wave that travels down their body"
  * see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undulatory_locomotion
  * undulation VS oscillation video (1min) by a manta: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aOh4ad0Li8
* metachronal rhythm (or metachronal wave)
  * the way a centipede moves with its dozens of legs (sequentially, not synchronized)
  * appearance of a traveling wave
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metachronal_rhythm
* necessary to segment body parts; very focused engagement of different parts
  * similar to spiral: "a delayed rotational movement", waves are "delayed (lateral) flexed movements" done sub-sequentially
* different planes:
  * frontal: left/right
  * sagittal: front/back
  * transversal: rotating around the center axis
  * starting/leading from different points
* exercises:
  * doing it against the wall
  * traveling a point through the body
  * increase complexity (not really application relevant, but increases awareness) by 2+ points/waves
* a never-ending continuation of kinetic force; has to be circular to not break it
  * by changing the direction (breaking the pattern; "priming" it): creating a strong whip-leash force
* aspects: anatomical waves; efficiency; joint function; martial arts; dance; somatic practices/therapy
* way to academic paper about rhythmic locomotion: https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/215/2/211/11077/Mechanisms-underlying-rhythmic-locomotion 
* peristalsis: automatic wave-like movement of muscles in gastrointestinal tract
  * different from segmentation: happens mainly in intestines; slows down; peristalisis continues gradually
  * retroperistalsis, antiperistalsis or reverse peristalsis = vomiting
  * wave-like movement: contract/relax in a continuous pattern; squeeze/push synchronized
 
OTHERS
================================================================================================================
* spiral wave patterns in neuroscience?!
  * "spiral-like, rotational wave patterns (brain spirals)"
* in optics
  * beta movement: optical illusion of apparent motion: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_movement
  * phi phenomenon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_phenomenon

DANCE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* sometimes called "body waves" or "body rolls"
* A wave in dance is a fluid and continuous movement that travels through the body in a rippling motion
  * see: https://sfconservatoryofdance.org/dance-techniques-glossary/wave/
* e.g. general body roll tutorial (5min): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jd1nuA61mc
* e.g. bachata (5min): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30F5806xV4k
* e.g. hip hop (8min): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbkUOBgJMFs
* e.g. breakdance:
  * arm wave ("popping"), 7min tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyh56156Ejc
* e.g. funk: "waving": https://dancewithceech.com/mastering-the-art-of-waving-a-fluid-funk-style-dance-move/
  * waving see also: https://dancebeat.lv/en/dance_styles/waving-2/
* e.g. "rippling" (also wave-like): https://sfconservatoryofdance.org/dance-techniques-glossary/ripple/
  * going into "liquid dance": https://sfconservatoryofdance.org/dance-terminology-glossary/liquid-dance-2/

MARTIAL ARTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* taijiquan:
  * two movement principles:
    * wave: linear, little space required
      * internal wave is not visible anymore, 1min: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejr8UgfDFyw
        * a shock into the other person's system ("bone breaker")
    * spiral: circular, lots space required
    * both can be combined
* systema:
  * to exert outgoing and reduce incoming force 
  * relaxation of all muscles, traversing kinetic force
  * only visual impression (3min): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixtFMBpJ9cc
  * applications: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8evhGDNSb9E
* karate/aikido 7min application: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_A1uswMp4Q

IN CI
================================================================================================================
* how do waves relate to CI?
  * where is this movement pattern being used? how is it useful? 
* for rolling point of contact (bulging out)
  * to be very specific about a single point (and not surface area)
  * being able to combine different planes to be able to freely move in any direction on any bodypart
 
PERSONAL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* my personal wish/ideas for content of this workshop...
* moving from big to small waves in the body
* more focused/precise (e.g. segmentation of the spine) body-awareness (breakdancer like)
  * increase isolation vs unity skill (muscle control)
* accordion style variation: when falling/dropping, reduce impact by compression
  * use fall to get up again, like a spring
  * thus, using it for "receiving and giving" force
* practice different qualities:
  * amplitude, frequency/speed, flow (also edgy/sharp)
  * different body parts (fingers, arms, torso, legs)
* ultimately reach more softness in the body (control without force, showing it the way)
