interview with tom goldhand about contact improvisation; 1st april 2024, amsterdam.

# 1. GENERAL

## 1.1 what is CI in one sentence?

* terminology/definitions are time-, space- and person-based (as well as CI is improvised, thus...)
  * asking the same question a day/week later, it will already change
  * at the beginning (70s) every time the did it, they would redefine it: "what is CI _now_"?
  * there is a rough body of agreement (congruent understanding) of what it is, and what it is not; a definition stable across time/space/practitioner
    * on the edges one can play; like the trunk (agreed principles) and it's branches and leaves (styles, adaptations)
* 1: exploration of physical forces, between two dancers, moving in contact and the ground
* or 2: a three body problem, two dancers, shaped/moved by momentum/gravity/force, dealing with the third body (=ground/earth).
* CI is an improvised art-form; art-sport

## 1.2 what is the "essence" of CI (in multiple sentences)?

* improvised partner dance (usually two people/bodies), exploration with the ground
  * dance moving by itself, according to our aims/wishes
* being in constant physical contact
  * more than just touch but *"sharing" weight* - leaning into each other, searching center (of gravity)
* with changing point of contact; using "*rolling point of contact*", no disengaging/re-engaging, at least not at the beginning
  * correcting each other to find balance

## 1.3 what are its principles?

* rolling point of contact
* sharing weight
* exploration of physical forces (momentum, gravity, friction, direction of movement in its changes in space)
  * newtonian physics in motion (not beyond = quantum)
  * spirals and how perceived/seen/anticipated a different movement in other bodies and yours
  * understanding of physics doesn't really help on a body level (might be interesting to see what you learned in physics though, what's yet "embodied")
  * not needed in order to use it/play with it
  * engineers smile hearing terminology from the world of leverage/friction/mutual point of contact/center of mass

## 1.4 its goals? why would someone start to do CI? what are its benefits?

* because it's fun
  * to avoid having to go to the gym and have much more fun in the studio 
* because it sparkles curiosity; explore exercises
* because of the love for the capacity to move in a new way, different ways
* because it's improvised (CI being part of the dance improvisation world)
* to connect to other people/bodies
* connect more to the body, less to the mind
  * we all have the same body (equalized), moving in space; independent of age/gender/sex/belief/religion/color
* a way to "handle life", a nice good place
* place to see humanity, or more: animality; in a good kind of way, monkey kind of way, which is fun
* workout -as a side effect (just more fun)
  * "some people lift weights, we lift bodies"; some people run to lose weight, we go dancing (not the main reason/intention though)
* maybe even: personal/social growth? philosophical practice? mental/spiritual practice
  * like in ballet: zone of awareness, meditative state (doing pliee for 15min+)
  * but in CI: small dance (=listening unconscious body reaction to maintain balance)
* less choreography: "why are we doing that" gets lost (reason); follow other person's idea
  * not serving the audience, but the audience joining me
* getting a visceral reaction from the audience of an improvisation art-form, that they want to join
* slow = meditative state; fast = in the flow/zone (to survive)
  * if not there: flow (fall) will tell you
* connection with others (although in the beginning not so much; create a piece, not community)
* starting point of exploration (only less than half stay with CI, others continue)

## 1.5 where does CI position itself? in terms of: dance, martial arts, acrobatics, sport, movement awareness practice, (dance/movement) therapy, ...?

* more of a dance (based on the person's background you ask)
  * yet not a thing of the professional dance world
  * embedded in contemporary dance form
  * also called "partnering": use of CI in choreographies
  * dance improvisation existed before (but didn't have the contact aspect as CI has)
    * although sometimes CI is called "contact dance"
  * introduced in new avant-garde dance schools in the US
* martial arts: founding people were many Aikidokas
* acrobatics: creator Steve Paxton himself was a gymnast
* visceral art form, art-sport
* people who go to ecstatic dance often would claim to have done "contact" but actually have no idea about CI
  * there is a confusion about "touch based partner dance" and the art-form of CI
  * these people might also bring in a slight different (sensual-sexual) energy which is not welcome in CI

## 1.6 how can it be compared to more conventional dance styles, like: contemporary dance, dance improvisation, or even zouk, tango, salsa, or lindy hop?

* most of those are partner dancing in a more social way; CI comes from the art world on the other hand
* they are very much gender-roled (men lead, women follow; except lindy hop); CI dances everyone with everyone, no clear role
* they are much more "stylish" (dress to impress); at CI we like to wear our comfy pyjamas ;)
* without the shared point of contact, it's only dance improvisation
* CI is an exploration; "breaking the system" as it is improvised (no choreography)
  * there is no difference between dancers and audience, no hierarchy 
* physical aspect: how to survive a high impact volume (crash or fall)
* difference modern and contemporary dance:
  * development: ballet - modern - contemporary
  * modern: e.g. martha gram, john cage, cunningham; choreographer 
  * contemporary: improvisation became not only a research tool, but performance itself
* they are mostly vertically (standing; no floorwork); at CI we roll over each other on the floor
  * they are walking with very nice movements
  * CI is a three-dimensional spherical space, were every bodypart can be a foot (pushed against the ground)
* lindy hop is using very strong acrobatics, which zouk also does a little
  * e.g. taking/lifting people on your body (core/center)

# 2. HISTORY

## 2.1 when/where/how/by whom was CI created?

* when: 1972
* where: ... somewhere US
* whom: steve paxton (the father), nancy stark smith (the mother)
  * with other dancers, gymnasts, acrobats
* how: took few weeks for research; high velocity, running into each other, bumping and surviving
  * see the old videos ("magnesium"), the progress from 72/75/87, narrated by steve
* steve stopped doing CI about 7 years after; gave it to the people
  * nancy held it after; she continued with another partner contact quarterly magazine (a vehicle to share ideas; the theme/practice of CI)

## 2.2 how was it back then different from today's CI?

* it was VERY different; sometimes we call it "old school contact"; some people still do it
* very high velocity and risk; looks amazing and scary
  * good to know: they trained on mats at the very beginning (see videos)
  * but after they did the same without mats, and got (quite a lot of) injuries...
* last few decades more emphasizes on flow (instead on "explosion"), and least resistant pathway
* some people claim that CI lost quite a lot of its characteristic along the way
* personal opinion: it's nice to have both, to be able to choose what you want
  * being able to survive the explosion, and play comfortable in the flow
* today there are different styles: more flow, more impactful, acrobatics, dance, acting
  * differences based on different teachers (lineages) but also culturally
  * different countries have different "body orientation"

## 2.3 why was it never trademarked?

* decided no cause/trademark/certification; using the contact quarterly instead as a vehicle (no hierarchy)
  * as always: a certificate doesn't mean you are good, just that you pass a certification
* downside: when word was spreading, more and more injuries started to happen
  * try not to teach what you don't know 
* ... check the books!

# 3. BEGINNER

## 3.1 what are the typical struggles for beginners? what are common mistakes made?

* on the physical aspect (body):
  * not using (giving) weight (not leaning) to the partner
    * reasons: fear of falling; fear of imposing your weight on another person ("am i too heavy/much", being a burden)
    * handshake, or touch on the shoulder, is common in our society - leaning is not
    * learn to do that, but: without stopping to breath and without tensing up (big struggle for beginners) 
  * not using "rolling point of contact", but "jumping point of contact"
    * we don't aim for "intimate body-parts" (buttocks, breasts, genitals), yet we roll over them "coincidentally" without staying there
    * e.g. my head would be at those parts, i will still try to avoid that (if possible; even if people know each other very well)
    * we try to desexualize the human body (not the partner, but the body); in our hyper-sexualized society can be difficult
    * the touch without a sexual intention will feel comfortable for both, even if intimate parts are being rolled over (more important the "how" than the "what")
    * we play with each other, just like kids are playing "rough and tumble" in the playground (before encountering the wonderworld of sexuality)
    * e.g. a doctor touching breast tissue with the intention to find signs of cancer, without any sexual intention; thus it feels safe for the patient
  * advanced people (who acquired that skill) can choose not to give weight/jump contact-points though
  * scary for people is: going to the ground; having lots of weight on you; giving (lots of) weight to a person on the ground; ...  
* on the psychological aspect (mind):
  * intimacy, sexuality (using entire body, rolling over it)
    * from the outside (not knowing the practice) might seem very intimate
    * not only physical level (close proximity in touch), but also sensual/sexual level (but it's NOT in its core)
    * switch of the mind necessary to change that

## 3.2 is it safe?

* short answer: no ;) it can be "safe enough" though (what we aim for)
  * less safe than jiujitsu/judo/MMA, more safe than poetry/running; it's a high intense form of dancing
  * also due to the unknown of your partner what they are bringing
* safety just can't be reached in the outside world, meeting each other; neither injured (physically) nor psychologically in pain
* be aware of the existing risks, yet expand the boundaries of what's possible

## 3.3 for whom is CI, for whom isn't it a good idea to join? (physical requirements? touch-averse people?)

* in general: everybody is welcome (not necessarily every behavior though) 
* not about age (even 70+ is possible), not about body ability
  * yet some techniques might not be possible, or would need some adaption
  * even a person with 72 years old, able shoulder lifts, doing it for many years; some of the crazy things might be though for "the next life" ;)
* but sharing weight, being in contact with another body, exploring what's happening (where's weight/unconscious reaction to balance/mind) = anybody can do
* even with partially disabled body (some physical disability)
  * even people in wheelchair can do it, together with physically fit people
  * or blind people: super in tune with weight and different other aspects
  * very different and interesting kind of exploration
    * renegotiate/re-explore what kind of communication we can play
* even with a huge weight difference, we just need to be more careful
  * which kinds of lifts, who is carrying whom how
  * no shoulder lifts, no rolling; negotiate what's possible
  * respect (check slowly, step-by-step) the abilities of the dance (both bodies), then it becomes safer (not necessarily safe!)
* otherwise, do the crazy things with a lot of care and guardian angels (people who spot you)
* theoretically (in an ideal world), everyone is welcome, yet: not advised for people with severe touch aversion (e.g. due to trauma in that field) to jump into CI (as a solution/practice)
  * better tippie toe in different kind of forms, then see if continue to CI
  * mental challenges sometimes make people join only one (or even a half) class (or the teacher might have doubts)
* people who take too many risks (the "dangerous ones"); throwing themselves on unknown partners
  * they won't be denied access to classes/jams, but dancers will most likely keep their distance as it won't feel safe

## 3.4 is any equipment necessary / beneficial? what kind of clothes (not) to wear?

* normal dancing movable sports clothes
* no zippers, no button-shirt, no jewelry (big earrings) ... as they can get trapped on other person's bodies/clothes or hurt someone
* in CI we need some friction for grip
  * plastic fabrics: will slide more, better cotton; e.g. the adidas pants, some love them, yet not preferred (slippery)
  * better without socks (or socks with these plastic nobs on the sole; for better grip), others will slide more
* custom is to have long trousers and sleeves (for sliding, enough friction and sweating)
  * some wear even 2 shits in hot summer (long underneath, short on top) :-/

## 3.5 how can i differentiate between a good and a bad teacher? (safe / unsafe community / jam)

* three realms to consider:
  * 1. physical aspect:
    * they know what they are teaching
    * also being honest about it limitations in that knowledge (humbleness)
  * 2. psychological aspect:
    * ability to hold space (for processes that might happen)
    * safety is about intention: not wanting to inflate ego (making bigger)
    * not wanting to gain anything outside the class (besides monetary compensation in formally agreed transaction)
    * no claim to be a master/guru; teacher is "one of us" (going for a drink with people, taking teacher hat off)
  * 3. spiritual aspect
    * absence of competition: wanting the student to be as good / better as themselves
    * pure intention to teach; sharing knowledge (also two-way though)

## 3.6 what are the unwritten, implicit socially accepted behaviors in CI? (talking? eye gazing?)

* making the implicit rules explicit
* start slowly
* don't eye gaze for too long (they will tell you that this is not the way) 
* in a class with a teacher there is more guidance
* in a jam it might be more difficult
  * take first 5-10 minutes to sit and watch / observe the "communal implicit norms"
  * every jam is different (yet there is a common set of baseline rules)
  * talk less (not too loud, not too long, not on the dancefloor)
  * don't "park" on the dancefloor (parking = lying on the floor, eyes closed, being unaware of surroundings)
* no sexuality: the teacher will take that off very fast (or the jam facilitator, if present)
* "appropriate" clothes (see further up); people won't dance with you because of that (not because of you as a person)
* personal hygiene: normal and above; shower; good smells (not too strong perfume)
* cuddles (cuddle puddles) will happen, and are being tolerated, but are not intentional!
  * the group will "notice" that behavior if that's your intention; again: people might not want to dance with you anymore
  * none prohibit it, some jams tolerate it, few invite it, but mostly it just doesn't happen
  * often there is a partner bodywork at the end (a typical thing dancers would do); a more technical/medical/sports massage than a personal/emotional/intimate touch session

# 4. SOCIAL

## 4.1 what does the community look like? how is it organized?

* the term "community" is about people living in the same place
  * sharing more knowledge about each other rather than a practice
  * helping each other in times of need
  * trend in our society: companies saying "come join the family"
* community here: group of people sharing the same passion for this practice
  * getting curious about the other person, from a very basic physical connection
  * their life, experiences, ideas... afterward often also sharing food; from their, friendship can happen
  * sometimes also just a great dance partner, but personally nothing in common with (not wanting to be friends)
  * less care for "only dance partners", less than for example neighbour
  * this is a bit off in the contact "community"
  * not really a: if they don't come (to classes/jams), they're not friends, we still reach out
  * in small classes, there is usually a sense of community; asking where one is; helping each other out (healthy issues, financially); support if needed
* there are silos, according to the attitude of the teacher/jam, people will converge into specific places (norms will differ based on that)
* collaboration over competition: CI people/teachers believe in what they do, the goodness that it gives to the world
  * they want to expand the pool to reach more people
  * maybe more competition if only source of income and rely on it (scarce modality); livelihood/hobby/passion
  * some teachers will invite guest teachers (if not here), or send people to another teacher (different city, or teacher being more technical)
  * not much "fighting" among CI practitioners happening, but also collaboration are not so often happening (it's a very individual practice)
* there are festivals, where (abroad) teachers are being invited
* usually city-based teacher (2-3 classes a week); sometimes there are "traveller teachers"
* usually when invited, then not by other teachers, but by schools/institutions/organizers
  * there is a win-win-win in having different student-teacher relationships in one's own workshop

## 4.2 can you give a description of a "stereotypical" CI person?

* wearing dance clothes; nothing casual/street clothes but also not too fancy
* age is a big range, yet for technical part it's usually around 25-45
* social economical a little bit on the high end (richer people; yet, teachers might be willing to give a discount to people who cant easily afford paying for the classes/workshops)
* strictly religious seem not to be attracted by it; most likely because of the touch, physical proximity 
* there is no clear stereotypical physical appearance for "CI people" (thinking of images we might have with yoga, hiphop, tantra, ...)
  * yet, CI people are very quickly spotted on the dancefloor, how they move, how they engage, behavior with weight
  * there is a mutual, unconscious ability to spot each other on the dancefloor which makes them find each other -like magic :)
* CI people have no need to attach themselves to a subculture and shape their personality around it; no need for "another stamp"
  * CI is about the physicality, and less a "spiritual practice for personal growth" (or community, as stated above)
  * the way we move might although influence our personality (as in increased sensuality when moving tango); but that's no such thing in CI
  * it's very egalitarian (no roles) and plain physical form; more technical/raw, no (moral) values conveyed; whereas the egalitarian approach might be a value it contains ;)
    * independent of sex/gender/age/body; no leading/following based on sex/gender, just play
* CI don't convince others of they greatness of CI, although everyone is invited and welcome to join; it's fun

## 4.3 how does such a very intimate touch based movement form in today's (distant) society?

* in very strictly gender-roled societies (e.g. not same-sex touch permitted), CI would have big problems to become popular
* western world is seen as non-touch societies, there are bubbles where it is allowed/encouraged
  * e.g. couple dancing (although not entire body, only holding/embracing arms and back)
  * because of the lack of touch/connection, us as social mammals, these bubbles might get more and more attraction
  * especially people who don't have people close to them (relatives, loved ones, partner; during COVID), feel that human need for touch
    * BUT: this is not the aim of CI, it's a very nice additional side effect
    * people who only come for that side effect, won't stay long in CI; there are other places where one gets touch for that purpose
* using CI to "heal the world" seems a bit... utopian (naive?), well-fitted for younger people, with lots of enthusiasm being eager
  * that eagerness comes because CI can change one's life
  * "if everyone would do CI there would be no wars anymore, and it would be the end of capitalism" - the young
  * "CI is a very, very rich, beneficial and amazing dance form, and it might not change the world, but it did change me" - the old
  * the more we spread it, the better ;)

## 4.4 aren't there lots of horny people rubbing their body's on each other?

* in classes, it happens very very very rarely (teacher taking care of a safe space for participants)
  * teachers will stop any form of sexual intended / predatory behavior right away, declaring it as a clear  "no-go"
  * that's also why people should go first to a class to learn the norms and values, instead dropping in a jam right away
* at jams without a supervisor no one knows (maybe relatively more often?)
  * often there is an organizer though, which can repeat clear rules and guidelines in an opening circle
  * minimizing the probability of such non-welcome behavior
* comparing to ecstatic or tantric dance with CI: in CI are waaaay less "horny people" showing up ;)

# 5. TECHNICAL

## 5.1 what makes a good CI practitioner good? (quality, attitude, skills)

* right intention for dance
* regarding attitude/mindset: curiosity (the antidote to being judgmental)
* a very important tool: listening to small sensations in the body (change of movement/weight)
  * increased awareness of incoming information (inside and outside the body; peripheral nervous system; "skinesphere")
  * being able to detect what's going on
  * being "well-informed" leads to becoming a much better dancer
* respect what your body is able to do (in regard to level, age, constitution)
* for many, dancing with totally beginners and total advanced is most enjoyable: reminder/showing different aspects of the dance
  * both are usually very happy to dance with each other
* intermediate are usually not happy to dance with beginners (only own level or higher)
  * they are usually the "dangerous" ones, as they know the pathways/tricks (form/looks), but they don't know what they don't know
  * lacking listening ability, if something happens not predicted in their pathways (quick changes and how to handle that)
  * often go faster than their level of attention; very often go faster than their beginner-partner's level of attention
* an advanced practitioner is really happy exploring the smallest thing, being able to keep a beginner's mind open
  * they know what they know, and they know what they don't know
* more general (for any form): kind (smiling, gentle, soft), humble (not showing off how many years is doing this-or-that, not arrogantly teaching beginners), patient (let the beginners do their own mistakes/gain own experience)
  * everybody teaches, there is no certificate; if you have a lot of knowledge, you will share that by your dancing
* years itself are not necessarily a guarantee for expertise/mastery!
  * some people get stuck at a certain level even after many years
    * even if technical level is advanced... the moment where one stops posing questions is where one stops developing
    * keeping a beginner's mind: keep on doing the very same thing (lifts and spirals), yet stay with curiosity and explore deeper (the small things/changes, where to focus now/put attention/intention)
  * even lots of experience itself doesn't mean your level of technical practise is going forward

## 5.2 what are the core movement principles/patterns?

* the techniques are based on the principles; the principles are core
  * short: 1) sharing weight 2) rolling point of contact
* recognizing weight; sharing weight
* recognizing/listen to your small dance (in each position)
  * classically done only standing (that's how it started; strongest way to balance due to small surface)
  * but: core is the perception of reaction to the process of balance
  * thus: in any position (except when completely lying down) there is a small dance, because the body is trying to balance itself
  * figuring out one's own and partner's center (as lifts are happening from there) 
* rolling point of contact (pathway)
* core movement pattern: spirals
* and lots of techniques around lifts
* later, once principles are embodied, they show up ("surprise you when they happen and change your pathways")
  * also in high velocity, risk engaged dance; with a super, super high level of alertness/attention; jumping on each other yet landing safely back on the ground

## 5.3 are there "clearly defined, labeled techniques" or is CI a more principle based system?

* yes, there are also techniques, but the principles are at the core of CI
* the difference between grammar (=principles; universal, abstract) and vocabulary (=techniques; specific, concrete)
  * even in the US we will use the same grammar, but the words (vocabulary) and especially style will be slightly different; small hiccups might happen
  * yet: we will be able to understand each other as the principles stay the same
* often necessary to stay a few hours with a new teacher to embody their body language, from which the vocabulary comes
* vocabulary like lifts is a rather regional expression of the application of the commonly shared principles

## 5.4 what are some of your favorite mottos?

* "we try not to fall in love with our partner, we fall in love with the dance"
  * because it's not a personal dance, it's a physicality; the experience is because of the practice, not because of your partner(s) necessarily; don't attach that to a specific person
  * even when had an amazing dance with someone, once the dance is over, i'm going to say "thank you, and bye bye"
    * possible to talk to that person later on, but not lingering and dance the entire class/jam with that person
* "dance at the edge of your level of attention, and don't cross the level of your partner's attention"
  * try to expand what you are able (movement/attention; speed, techniques, pathways)
  * listen to what your partner is able as well
* also: tension masks sensation (by steve paxton)

## 5.5 most used classes' animals (octopus, koala, panda, elephant) and sounds (oomph, bots, wee, mooshimooshi)

* there are no universal names for techniques/qualities, but different teachers try to invent, share, and give credits to their inventions.
  * an oral tradition has established of passing information
  * animals are beneficial as they have a very visual characteristic; visceral experience; qualities that animal embodies
  * useful to convey an idea (otherwise many, many sentences would be needed; the whole purpose of introducing and using jargon, not to smartass, but for increased information exchange/more dense)
* animals as an attempt to introduce technical vocabulary for positions and techniques:
  * chicken wing: using a "semi lock" with the arm pit on the partner while being lifted (or similar); often necessary if centers are not stacked and being unbalanced
  * chicken leg: the same as the chicken wing but with the hip flexed
  * koala: a hug basically; hugging a partner's torso while hanging on him sideways (either around shoulders or pelvis)
  * octopus: quality movement where all joints/whole body is involved in a relaxed/soft manner
  * (little) elephant: when someone falls, the sound when landing hard with the feet (either walking or landing from lift); indication of no control/no relaxation
  * panda: ???
  * crab: ???
  * banana: extending the whole body as a bow; can be practiced on the ground, but applied often while being on the back of a partner
* "sounds terms" as an attempt to introduce technical vocabulary for qualities (fuzzy principles) and more abstract phenomena:
  * oomph: giving/sharing weight, not only a slight touch, but really firm, high pressure contact
  * bots: (=to clash/collide) when the instruction conflict with your inner wisdom (e.g. jumping, but you feel lots of fear/resistance to do so); when the teacher's words conflict (bots) with what you want/don't want, the inner teacher always wins (dutch word; bot=bone; like two fists smashed on each other)
  * wee: sung sound; allowing the body to relax the atmosphere/to release tension/to calm down; counteracting fear/panic (e.g. while being lifted); everybody smiles
  * hoopity poop: fancy technical, acrobatic stuff; looking impressive yet not necessarily shows much skill (jumping on each other)
  * mooshy mooshy (mushy? mooshi?): non-clear/sensual intention, very slow, cuddle puddles 
  * lala land: a cute way to refer to the esoteric, superstitious world; things which are better suited in the metaphysical world (spirituality, religion)

# 6. OUTRO

## 6.1 in which direction will CI develop in the next 10 years?

* hopefully it will keep a very strong trunk
  * people keep on researching the practice, still knowing where it comes from, its roots
  * welcoming the branches, e.g.: CI combined with other practices like "contact tango", "contact beyond contact"... or CI with using substances for "other states of awareness"
  * as the tree is branching, that the main trunk will stay the main trunk
  * that there is no need for the distinction between "i am a CI purist" and simply: "i'm doing CI"
  * the last 50 years the trunk stayed stable, yet the last 20 years lots of branches emerged; branches which merge different forms together
  * also good, those branches/merges, that people are aware that that's not CI the way it is actually practiced
  * what's needed: good teachers/jams/spaces where the ideas/principles are held from CI; knowing the physical aspect but also the history

## 6.2 any good books (websites, movies) about CI you recommend watching?

* contact quarterly website ("official CI channel") 
* material for the spine, by steve paxton (after he did some CI), a new line of research
* underscore, by nancy stalks smith
* videos (good practice to watch them once in a while):
  * magnesium, fall after newton, ... (everything between 1972 and 1980)
* books (about 10 good ones which are specifically for CI):
  * sharing the dance, by cynthia novack
  * dancing deeper still, by martin keogh

## 6.3 something to tell people who never tried but are curious about it now?

* check some youtube videos
  * don't be intimidated from what you are seeing (usually only high level people publish videos; that's not what you are going to encounter at first)
* join a recommended teacher
* go first to some classes (not immediately to jams; only after 10-20 classes, to have the basic principles embodied)
* don't give up if your very first experience seems bad; maybe you want to try another class/teacher
* CI is not only physical; ask yourself: why and what am i doing; this is very beneficial and inspiring
