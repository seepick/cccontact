PART 1: movement qualities

1.1 what is "grounding"? what's the difference to "earthing/rooting"? how do you achieve it (exhale)? what is it NOT? its applications?
================================================================================================

UPFRONT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* externally not much (or even nothing) visible, no change
* working with gravity, through relaxation
  * muscle relaxation allows to be more sensitive; quicker reactions, as "tension masks sensation"
  * if too much relaxation => collapse
* summed up: always about balance/moderation/the middle (avoiding extremes; physical and mental)
* naturalness of taijiquan, where positions "find themselves"
* applications: a buffer, indulgence, soft, elastic, deform; for explosion/pull/push
* in martial arts: to destabilize the center of the other (competition); in CI: to support the center of the other (collaboration)
* too much (and too little) of anything is bad; extremes; the dose makes the poison
  *  also with grounding; the centerpoint too low, legs get heavy; no more agility/adaptability
* grounding has to go into the lower belly, not too deep (ground) otherwise too stiff
* rooting taijiquan: good connection with the ground, minimum effort
  * prerequisite: whole body's structure must be permeable, to allow flow of force into the ground and back again
    * also: coordinated alignment, to be able to relax (low muscle tone); for body and mind
    * coordinated mental alignment = direct attention to bodily sensations/movements; clear distinction of yin and yang (activity/calmness, burden/relief, contract/relax, ...)
    * coordinated physical alignment = relation of all body parts so that they support each other and the center
    * coordinated mental relaxation = sourced in alignment; mindful practice leads to calmness, body will relax more
      * the breath can be used as a connection between body and mind; slow, conscious exhaling activates the parasympathetic nervous system (reducing stress, restlessness); or you can simply observe its automated self-doing
    * coordinated physical relaxation must happen synchronously; requires a calm and attentive mental state
  * externally: visible as an impression of elastic solidity
  * internally: struggle to stay upright, calm, relaxed and balanced
* relaxation (letting go) is always directed towards the center
  * body structure will get firmer/stronger with getting stiffer
    * inner pressure lowered by surrendering; to reach to the outside from within
    * use muscles as little as possible; that's how the maintain their (re)action-potential
    * other tissue (tendons, ligaments, fascia) carries the weight/tension
  * tradition states: on the inside hard like iron, on the outside soft like cotton wool
* differentiated between body regions which are assigned yin (receiving) and yang (giving) qualities
  * yang regions are loosened; they redirect ascending force to the outside (e.g. the back, outer sides of arms/legs)
  * yin regions are even more loosened; they redirect received force into the center and the feet (e.g. chest, belly, leg/arm inner side)
* by releasing/dissolving, the whole body interconnects; every point connected with the ground
  * the resulting quality is very elastic, permeable and stable
  * to maintain that state also in movement, you must not disturb it through uncoordinated tension
* to relax doesn't mean to be limp/flabby/lax; use of minimum effort, to maintain external form
* in application, possible to receive force, store it in tissue, and then either give it back (counter-attack) or dissolve it, let the enemy run into emptiness, make him fall, and add that force into his (down-)fall
* the powerful force behind a taijiquan punch

TRANSCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* rooting
  * = connected to the ground, with minimum effort
  * to be able to transmit/distribute incoming forces (gravity, kinetic force from outside; a push/pull)
  * it's like balancing, a constant/dynamic process (there is no absolute, fixed point)
    * usually unconscious; micro-movements; thinking/talking; internal (organs); even breath influences balance/body structure
  * two main ingredients: alignment and relaxation
  * 1) alignment: body can support itself
  * 2) song quality {or is it "song"?!} (=relax, let go)
    * but not flabby (without losing one's external shape)
    * minimum effort of muscle tension; replaced by internal, elastic, connected tension; able to receive/perceive/store; like rubber
    * relaxation starts in the mind, so that the body can follow
      * first parasympathic work: mindfulness, breath/exhale
    * to allow to do nothing, to do the non-doing, real "song"
    * through song, inner force, opening (kai) from the inside (song kai)
    * ultimately every connected with each other, every point in body, own and others, and ground
    * not only relaxed and aligned, but coordinated, dynamic alignment; relax mentally and physically
    * to align to gravity properly: as little energy necessary to stay upright
      * and also to one's center (dantien)
      * but also all (bigger) joints have their own center
      * inner structure: each supporting each other: wrist supports elbow, supports shoulder, supports scapula, supports spine 
      * outer structure: fascia/tendons/ligaments
      * ultimately that muscles can max. relax (more sensations/feeling possible); to be more "response-able"
    * mental alignment: attention focused onto the body/movement
      * like throwing a bone to the puppy (less capacity to get distracted)
    * the concept of rivers: keeping them open, and not blocking them (tension; closed joins/narrow angles; raised shoulders)
    * yin/yang categorization of movement/body is very basic; no complex conceptualization required; immediate experience is just there by itself, effortless
      * soft/hard, slow/fast, away/towards me, up/down, rooted/uplifted, 
    * it starts with the mind, then the body follows
      * focus on lower body, pressure on soles of feet, exhalation
    * relaxation, just like movement, is a coordinated process
      * just letting go my shoulder, doesn't automatically mean that my body is relaxed
      * maybe one is more relaxed, but then the other is more tensed; body will not be straight
    * in taiji warm-up (sang gung fung): all about becoming aware
      * to be more conscious of the weight of the body
      * to relax single parts more consciously; yet everything must relax; in a coordinated, centered manner
      * the relaxation has a direction: towards the center, which itself points downwards (a connection to the ground is thus established)
      * nothing needs to be done to root: only align and relax
        * everything else are methods/tricks to make that easier
          * to relax the mind more, to open the joints (bent knees/hips; springy quality of the legs)
          * without these it's still possible, but more difficult
          * softly bent, like the natural shape of the spine; upright but not hold tightly (with unnecessary force/muscle tension)
    * the ultimate goal: finding a neutral, comfortable, natural state for all bodyparts
      * everything has its own center
    * it's basically about (internal) perception, and self-exploration
      * finding proper alignment (implementing/executing) requires sensing one's own body (proprioception/feeling)
      * if you can feel properly, every part will find itself naturally its right position
    * not to hold it tight, but to "swim in our joints/tissue"
* ad application:
  * connection is the base for any application
    * body will become receptive, like a cushion; delaying, creating more time to interpret (information) and act
      * creating spacetime, through body and mind quality, easy to adapt one's own structure to the situation (e.g. taking a step)
    * being able to take in incoming force, and store it (in order to release again; either giving it directly back, or letting it "disappear")
  * trying to maintain posture in an elastic way; allowing the body to "shapeshift" (shifts/morph its shape)
  * also additionally: "quality of strength"
    * it can be quick and explosive; or more permanent and pushing; or pulling or grabbing (=closing)
  * in taijiquan (as a neijia wushu, a method), the application is in the martial arts aspect
    * following taiji principle, we can apply it everywhere in (daily) life
      * e.g. opening a door / holding open a closing door
      * or in dance, sports, weight lifting, massage, ...
* what is grounding?
  * robust/firm standing/stance? or connection to the floor/ground? the image of roots into the ground?
  * contradiction of controlled letting go; balance between collapse and stiffness; soft yet strong, to increase stability
  * and why?
    * to be reliable (in dance/acrobatics); to be able to be lied on; to support
    * to not lose once center/balance easily, to be more "indifferent" (a bit stoic)
  * vs earthing? more psychological, internally; more down to earth, facts, material; less flying up in the sky, airy, lala land, ethereal
* the more advanced someone is, the less external change is happening/visible
  * yet, there will ALWAYS be some external change (muscle tension); just not visible by the naked eye anymore
    * when a muscle relaxes, it shrinks (in volume/space)
  * thus, as beginners, we need to exaggerate, and make things very big, because our sensory utilities are not fine-tuned enough (resolution too low; not zoomed in enough)
  * this change in grounding-relaxation, is also perceivable via touch: let a person be tense, touch him, then he relaxes, then you should feel a change in his tissue
  * not being relaxed, often means not being centered
    * tissue/muscles are still strained/closed
    * relaxation allows joints to rest in its optimal/natural position
    * this will (has to!) lead to a change, which is also visible in a (tiny) movement
  * don't try to imitate the master, by not moving, getting stiff/rigid
    * it's not about total stillness! there is a bit movement, like a tree, passive; yet stable (deep roots, firm trunk)
    * it is more about the principle; the outer shape will follow
  * imagine starting with a terrible posture; stiff, joints locked, not upright
    * when then starting to relax/center/ground, then there will be a lot of visible movement happen
* most taijiquan teachers claim: every movement is a sequence of postures
  * but maybe (also) the other way round: every posture is a screenshot captured of a movement (a more dynamic approach)
  * stillness, a fixed position, is just a human mind made up concept (universe is a constant flux; nothing is constant)
  * we would need to put a lot of effort to keep the body absolutely still; and even then, we wouldn't achieve it 100% (see CI's small dance)
    * there is breath, blood circulation, slight vestibular micro-adaptions
    * it's very theoretical, like 0 kelvin in physics: nothing is moving
      * it's an asymptotic goal: we can only get closer (very close actually) but still never will be able to reach it
      * also in physics: 0 was never measured
    * yet, we are talking about human level of perception; we are totally far away from atomic scale; irrelevant to us
      * just as quantum mechanics is irrelevant for classical mechanics
      * just as the fact that there are no separate entities are irrelevant (useless, maybe even counter productive) for the human experience (yes, there is a spoon!)
  * same mentally: in deepest meditation, there is no absolut stillness
    * even while sleeping there is activity
    * only achievable when one is dead
    * it seems also to be not to be the goal
  * daoism classics: dao de jing / lao tse, chuang tse, lia tse (rip off of other two)
    * lia tse: the one who flies with the wind
    * goal: mind not trying to hide/exclude something; tries not to hold on (to a thought); same as with mindfulness practice (goal is not emptiness/stilness, but a higher awareness/consciousness)
    * thus: same also physically: not about total stillness, but about letting be, and letting go, in awareness
    * whatever happens, happens because it's stimulated internally or externally
      * in any case, we try to support, to continue whatever is (and not harshly change/interrupt it)
      * movement is happening out of disbalance; the goal is not totally 50/50 balance, as it would not be able to give birth to movement/dynamics
    * when "standing still", we constantly swim from disbalance to disbalance (CI's small dance)
      * you could call it "dynamic balance" (not constantly, perfectly in the middle)
      * in the middle it is silence; stiff; unmoveable; through polarity it creates dynamic; life is dynamic; balance is dynamic
    * conclusion: any willful suppression of natural adaption is wrong (=not in alignment with universal principles of existence)
* is grounding/rooting only relaxing into gravitational pull towards earth's center, or can i ground into force of a partner?
  * first connection is not into the ground, but with one's own alignment with the middle ("dantien" called in taijiquan)
  * not only gravity, but also body mechanics: we are not a stick; we have joints and structure
    * try to be less of a firm stick, but more like a dynamic ball
  * the center is in line with gravity (with earth's center)
    * resulting in a stronger/heavier structure
      * something used/experienced in push hands exercise
      * i'm like the earth, he like the moon; i have much influence on him, he little on me; he touches me slightly, immediately feels uncomfortable, because my center of gravity is stronger
  * in taijiquan, we don't like (yet it happens) to fold the center of gravity in the middle, where the hands have contact
    * we will lose our own center of gravity; like to sticks leaning on each other (shared center); but one relies on the other; none of them has an own center
  * in classical wrestling they do "build a bridge"; sharing their center, leaning on each other
    * because it's not relevant whether to fall on the floor, but more to be on top when going to the floor
  * in taijiquan, we try to create such a strong center through grounding, that the opponent leans on us, but we not on him
    * at least theoretically it's the (asymptotic goal): in reality, when things happen quick and lots of force, there will be a dynamic interplay of balance and disbalance, of leaning and grounding
    * not about how to maintain balance, but how to get back once it's lost
    * have strategies to regain balance: relax, or maybe shift weight, or maybe make a step
* many of the following questions here, are based on what has been said here
  * grounding, and its essence, what's needed, etc. encapsulates already much of any other further/more complex quality
  * grounding is the prerequisite for other things to happen


1.2. what is the relation between grounding (center of gravity) and floating (center of levithian)? as in: lower body yin/stable, upper body yang/soft, like a tree.
================================================================================================

UPFRONT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* taiji-grounding implies floating in the upper body
* use intention to sink the center even below the feet; but: at the price of adaptability (extreme grounding)
* structure of stance in taijiquan like a tree: a gradient of firmness
  * center downwards, structure is solid and elastic
  * center upwards, towards hands, solidity gets less (useful in boxing)
    * mobility important in area between shoulders and hands; elasticity can receive/exert force
* one could see the body's center as most stable area
  * esp. practical when quick/light footwork required (steps, kick, jumps)

TRANSCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* grounding = center of gravity VS floating / center of leviathan
  * base grounds, flyer floats (as in acrobatics)
  * analogy of tree: body separated in lower=grounded upper=float
    * => in taijiquan, this is already included in grounding; a cone shaped structure
      * heavy, but elastic and adaptable above
      * wind can't break a tree, not because he is so strong, but because he is so flexible; like dead, dry, brittle sticks, easily breakable; but a simple grasshalm, a tornado can't damage, as it's too soft, and too small
* an elastic quality allows grounding
  * otherwise would need to pull oneself with force towards the floor; with tension
  * it works too; some systems uses that; but it's not taiji-grounding
    * taiji prefers a different approach, to allow for more adaptability (respond freely, change)
* having the center of mass in the chest is not really used in taijiquan, as this system is based on grounding
  * it is nevertheless known and used sometimes; e.g. kicks/double kicks
  * quick and strong inhales, to make oneself light and bring the center of mass up
  * mid-air already switch to grounding, to have bigger impact on landing (crushing bones/joints)
  * but taijiquan doesnt have many kicking/jumping techniques; rather grounded, close-quarter
* movement principles in taijiquan:
  * first: spirals (round/circular, any direction)
  * second: waves (linear, more front-back)
    * when waves made bigger, the travel up to the chest
* just to repeat: the CoM is in the center, not in the chest, but also not in the feet, or even lower (some confuse that!)
  * not lower than center, as it comes at the price of adaptability
  * can't dance around, quick moves, even shifting weight
  * adaptability > grounding; to be able to shape-shift
  * for a short moment, same as with up, we can also go extremely low with our CoM (if required); but we usually don't stay there
* context defines good/bad:
  * in acrobatics, when doing handstand, CoM in chest is of advantage
  * jumping difficult if CoM in center; impossible when it is in the feet
* every part of the body can be a center, especially the main structures/joints; thus a CoM (at least thought, with the idea/intention)
  * in chinese medicine, chest is the middle center, head the upper (dantien the lower)


1.3 what is "yielding" for you? where are its extremes (collapse)? how do we achieve and where apply it? 
================================================================================================

UPFRONT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* yielding is prerequisite for adaptation (to gravity = grounding)
  * the essence of adaptation is yielding = evolution, survival of the fittest
* the invest into losing (ins verlieren investieren ==> ad motto)
* collapse put differently: "being sloppy/lax"
  * yet, on first touch, never resist; but not like paper
  * soft/elastic resistance, yielding quality
    * like a ball pushed underwater, un-intentionally wanting to come up but by itself so
    * chinese word for nature "zeran"; ze=self, ran=in this way/correctly; "to be as it is"
* to resist is not a desired attribute in taijiquan
  * BUT: that doesn't mean that we are sloppy/weak
  * taijiquan is known for its stance and to maintain its space
* firmness is created through relaxation
  * rooting, as well as "resistance", is actually a receiving/observing/adapting/yielding
* opening the inside (kai, or peng), achieved through coordinated relaxation (song), gives body an elastic quality (next to firmness and rooting)
  * through deformation on the surface (receiving external force), the inner firmness increases; like squeezing a rubber ball
  * this enables us to be more sensitive, interpret more, and act accordingly

TRANSCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* yielding necessary to develop good "song" quality
* let go of the idea, that you can achieve anything with (more) muscle tension (in the context of taijiquan)
  * it's more about developing "inner strength" (lu vs jing)
* chen man ching: "to invest into losing" (ins verlieren investieren)
* it's less about accumulating/more, but more about getting rid of, less; until only the essential is left
  * not about holding on; forcing it; closing/stiffen
* yielding: to not even start to fight if you know you are going to lose anyway
* "on the first touch, never resist" -chen bing
  * but not to be extremely soft like paper
  * there IS structure; but don't push against
* it's about developing some soft, elastic properties (for adaptability)
  * the essence of adapting is yielding (to give in)
  * e.g. think of evolution and natural selection; a species needing to adapt new environmental conditions (cold); it doesn't fight against it (temperature), but change themselves (more hair)
  * to accept of what is; making the best out of it
  * in taijiquan, the best = maintain one's center
* grounding could be seen as adapting to gravity; thus yielding necessary again
  * in partner exercises: force comes from that person
  * in standing exercise: force of gravity pulls in every point of our body
  * and we yield to any of those forces; without losing our structure (relax, not collapse!); staying upright; not resisting
* standing meditation (like "small dance"): there is no incoming force, but gravitational force pulling on every point of our body
  * we yield to that "pressure" (force), as much as possible to maintain structure (stay upright)
  * every system strives for balance (the body for homeostasis, physical for entropy)
    * when we push into something/someone, we get an equal force pushed back into us (newton)
  * it's a continuous process of relaxation within tension, but not a static state
  * to maintain is to hold; there is no such thing as "staying relaxed"
    * there is just a "constant yielding with gravitation", in combination with internally erect against it
    * this needs to be practiced; first it's active (effortful), later it becomes an automated habit


1.4 how do the aforementioned qualities relate to push/pull?
================================================================================================

UPFRONT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* what's a "sideway push/pull", and is it even semantically possible (based on the definition of push/pull)?
  * one dimension, just direction different; it's relative...
* is grounding a prerequisite for push/pull?
  * thinking of a gravity-free space, nothing can be received/stored (pushing oneself away; impulse-theory)
* in taijiquan, pulling is considered a yin-quality
  * a movement/force directed towards the center (proximal)
* to shove/push/thrust is considered a yang-quality
  * a movement/force directed to the outside (distal)
* in both cases the center must be maintained
* if someone pulls us, the elasticity will give us some time buffer
  * we are able to follow, and push into the pull, so that the other person will be hurled away (fortschleudern)
  * his own force is acting against him (our force added to his)
* if someone pushes us, the elastic reception allows us to interrupt to push by a quick pull
  * the attacker loses his balance
* taijiquan uses a partner exercise (sparing) called "pushing hands", where these dynamics can be practiced well (and carefully/softly with each other, not against each other)


TRANSCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* pulling has two aspects:
  * external aspect in application, obviously
    * in partner exercises we get pushed or pull
    * can be imagined just like with gravity: just the direction is a different one
      * the challenge is to align the gravitational vertical force with the pull coming from the opponent
      * so that they "communicate with each other" and the body can redirect them downwards
  * structural aspect: pulling top of head upwards; not tensed up, but like suspended in the air/heaven/sky
    * creates an inner tractive power, elongating (doing so without lots of muscle effort => tension!)
    * to avoid too much tension, we drop the tailbone downwards (the opposite of pull is here not push but song/song kai quality)
* push-pull: operate on some dimension/spectrum; one inwards (towards center) other outwards (away from center)
  * every definition has a relative reference point (although from outside it might look differently); in relation to my center/-line
* taiji philosophy is all about that everything is relative
  * optimal alignment, neutral joint position, ... how my position is (relative) to the other's position; how does it relate/adapt
  * to not only be well aligned within myself, but also in relation to the other
* possible to answer a push with: grounding, evasion, yielding (nachgeben), or pull
* possible answer to pull: grounding, give in (go quickly into, conquer space, "seal" his arms), disconnect arms (open them; using spirals)
* for push-pull and any application: basic requirement is always to have good grounding
  * first redirecting force into the floor, then into the arms; if connection is direct, this happens almost simultaneously
  * we cannot push-pull anything without support (the floor); think of astronauts in space
    * if you have a wall behind you, you can push very strongly (now just redirect/bend the force into the ground)
* taijiquan punch is done with the whole body (quick and explosive)
  * force into feet, over back into the arms
  * pull is similar: quick and explosive; in friendly partner practices we do it slowly (safety! sensitivity)


1.5 what is "reaching"? what is "extending"? where would you see the difference?
================================================================================================

UPFRONT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* those terms are rather uncommon and not used in taijiquan
  * maybe reach yes, but not extend
  * more commonly used the term of expansion (pang jin)
* reaching is used to establish connection (between me and the opponent)
* extension could be interpreted as elongating
  * elongating in order to establish a connection, or to bridge/narrow distance
  * e.g. during pushing hands (tuishou), when being very close, the arms have to go up above the head 
* extension, thus, would be a tool of range, whereas reaching can also be applied in close proximity

TRANSCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* extending: increase once distance, expansion
  * make once moves bigger, to occupy more space
  * the closer we are, the more we extend sideways/upwards/downwards, as the arms have no space between; to extends once reach "externally"
  * also, while retreating, hands stay positioned in 3D "absolute" space, extending while moving back
* reaching: always necessary in tuishou/pushing hands, partner exercise
  * to make contact essential; long or short distance (doesn't need necessarily extending)
* through sinking, uprising force generated, can be used to extend arms; everything starts to open
  * arms can even be head height, still feeling effortless
* taijiquan qualities: maintain structure, permeability, elasticity, listening
  * the whole structure needs to change, when a single point is being changed; like the surface of a ball
  * the middle point though stays the same, the center truly maintained, while everything on the surface changes
  * everything is moving synchronously in relation to each other; and everything in relation to the body center
*
