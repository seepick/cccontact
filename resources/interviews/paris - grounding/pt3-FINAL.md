PART 3: other


3.1 how much do you use intention and attention, and other mental/visual tools? 
========================================================================================================================

* we use images to move, which result in different movements; easier understanding of complex concepts
  * like crutches, too abstract otherwise for our minds to comprehend
  * similarly the meta-physical concept of qi in taijiquan
  * "yi activates qi, qi activates jing" (yi = intention, jing = movement)
    * qi being a transfer of information of these two entities (mind/abstract and body/concrete); the holy trinity
    * idea/will is the first spark, ignites "something" (using qi as a placeholder concept, as it is unknown; qi = air)
      * something is happening we can't see/feel/perceive (like air, or the steam coming from rice)
      * and suddenly there is movement, due to our will
* yin (passive, attention), yang (aktiv, intention)
  * yang = (chinese yi, one of the 5 spirits in chinese medicine) intention/active, yin = attention/passive
  * taiji principle: yin-yang; we use the basic dynamic of doing and non-ding to move
  * doing always starts with intention / intention creates doing; then letting go, and switch into attentive state (periphery vision/listen/feel)
    * while doing (yang strong) we can't listen that well (yin strong); that's in the nature of things
    * intention requires focus (concentration)
* attention is open presence (wide/big, like peripher vision)
  * concentration is focused presence (narrow/small, punctual)
  * are there non-led/intentional movements, which go by themselves? e.g. throwing?
  * is it actually possible to move my body directly, or is there always some "hidden layer" in-between?
  * layer translation: (we usually operate on layer 0-1)
    * an idea of an activity (1) to neuro-muscular connection (0)
      * eg: we don't really reach for a cup, although that's the layer we operate on; because underneath, certain muscle fibers are being contracted by neurons (which is beyond our perception)
    * in taijiquan (1-2 layer): abstract principle, of yin/yang (2) and idea of an activity (1)
    * feldenkrais for example puts very much attention on layer 0, all the details and subtleties there
    * where is CI located...?
* metaphor of asterix and obelix (neuroscience):
  * asterix makes the plans, like a fine pen/dagger
  * obelix executes those plans, a primitive hammer
* the images we use to move our body, significantly changes the way we engage our muscles
* chinese philosophical meta-physical concept of qi as a tool (an abstraction, yet not reality)
  * using it for our intention, to improve our movement execution
* intention is actually a rather short moment; not the whole movement execution is filled with it (but many different approaches there)
  * like a trigger of a pistol: the trigger is the intention; bullet flying is filled with attention (no intention required)
  * the earlier we let go of intention once the trigger is pulled, we can go quicker into the attention state
    * if we punch with our fist throughout the whole flying through the air with intention, we don't realize (missing attention) that our opponent already has raised his defense shields and evaded our trajectory, and threw something against as ages ago
    * while in a focus mode (focal point), we don't realize this (closed, tunnel vision; no open awareness)
      * focus mode also ignores the internal sensations; relevant to keep balance
  * intention is like an ignition; can be released quickly again; similar to how we use muscle tension: build up and release quickly again, to maintain lightness/gentleness
    * don't lead the movement, it won't be smooth; they are usually sloppy, or just edgy/jerky; too tight; not adaptable
  * a push is a lead movement until the end; but a thrown punch is lead only at the very beginning, then let go
    * within the martial arts concept of boxing, it can be considered as bad, as we need quick, explosive movements
    * within medical application, this intentionally lead movements could be beneficial (relative/context)
    * within dance: lifting someone, leading movement is useful
    * the function/application determines what important/correct is
  * it starts with intention, followed by letting go, and finally the movement happens
    * letting go makes it easy to adapt
    * leading is control; controlling what we want to feel
    * to let go is to stick (adhesiveness) effortlessly to your partner; to lead is to actively need to chase him
      * adhesiveness, to follow effortlessly, without looking for it; like water: filling space in between (mushin principle)
      * it happens through structure and the idea of movement and trained body quality
    * only big movements need slight correction occasionally
* general art might require intention as well, but what it requires more is dedication
  * like in zen: when you eat you eat, when you sleep you sleep; fully, with full attention
  * when you practice, then it's like a fight; not like as in tensed up or hard working or image being attacked...
    * but with the same attention and care with your movements, as it would be a question of life and death
  * and later, fight as if it would be practice/play; a relaxed attention, like when playing; fearless, worryfree, no overly control
  * if overly attentive, usually leads to over-control and tension

3.2 wie regulierst du deinen muskeltonus waehrend dem ueben?
========================================================================================================================

* how can you practice more from within a healthy center? to be not too stiff nor too sloppy?

* TODO

3.3 how much is physics important for taijiquan? or bio-mechanics/anatomy in a more broader sense, and classical mechanics/gravity in a narrow sense. do you use terms/concepts like vectors/momentum/centrifugalforce/ballistic (throwing fist,explosiveness)/lever technique? how about chinese terminology of force/energy, a la peng/lu/ji/an...? 
========================================================================================================================

UPFRONT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* just see how wonderful our human body is, what it can do, when trying to redo it yourself:
    * https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=boston+dynamics+atlas
      * how difficult it is, our daily human movements: try to redo it, tell a machine how to do it... amazingly difficult
* in dance, usually function follows form (function=effectiveness/efficiency/health; form=aesthetics/impress/express/looking good/performance/acting) VS expression (might not have aesthetics; modern dance/buto)
  * professional-competitive sports / martial arts: form follows function (goal is more pragmatic)
    * it has to work; what works is right
    * how to determine which is better? two people enter a room, one leaves, the other one is being carried out

* TODO

3.4 CI has a practice called "small dance" (being aware of unconscious micro movements to stay balanced/upright); how does it relate to taijiquan's/qigong's standing meditation what is the ame?
========================================================================================================================

* micromovements in balance; breathing, heartbeat, even thinking!
* to be more sensitive, fine-tuned (higher resolution in awareness); more nuanced/differentiated
  * more smaller parts; focused/magnified/zoomed; to be correct/exact/precise

3.5 how important is "pathway continuation" (maintaining/continuation of movement direction; inertia, momentum, anticipation) in taijiquan? if so, how is it being practiced
========================================================================================================================

* TODO

3.6 how does taijiquan implement spirals? how are they similar/different from CI's interpretation?
========================================================================================================================

* where do spirals start from? where do they go through? which planes?
* spirals even present anatomically in our bodies (muscle structures)
  * thus, arms/legs want to rotate based on how they are built
  * thus, there seems to be a physical justification for the naturalness/rightness of spiral movements (myfascial chains)
