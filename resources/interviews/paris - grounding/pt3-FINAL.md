PART 3/3: Other

3.1 how much do you use intention and attention, and other mental/visual tools?
========================================================================================================================

* we use images to move, which result in different movements; easier understanding of complex concepts
 * like crutches, too abstract otherwise for our minds to comprehend
 * similarly the meta-physical concept of qi in taijiquan
 * "yi activates qi, qi activates jing" (yi = intention, jing = movement)
   * qi being an information transfer of these two entities (mind/abstract and body/concrete); the holy trinity
   * the idea/will is the first spark, ignites "something" (using qi as a placeholder concept, as it is unknown; qi = air)
     * something is happening we can't see/feel/perceive (like air, or the steam coming from rice)
     * and suddenly, there is movement, due to our will
* yin (passive, attention), yang (active, intention)
 * yang = (Chinese yi, one of the 5 spirits in Chinese medicine) intention/active, yin = attention/passive
 * taiji principle: yin-yang; we use the basic dynamic of doing and non-ding to move
 * doing always starts with intention / intention creates doing; then letting go, and switch into attentive state (periphery vision/listen/feel)
   * while doing (yang is strong) we can't listen that well (yin is weak); that's in the nature of things
   * intention requires focus (concentration)
* attention is open presence (wide/big, like periphery vision)
 * concentration is focused presence (narrow/small, punctual)
 * are there non-led/intentional movements, which go by themselves? e.g., throwing?
 * is it actually possible to move my body directly, or is there always some "hidden layer" in-between?
 * layer translation: (we usually operate on layer 0-1)
   * an idea of an activity (1) to neuromuscular connection (0)
     * e.g., we don't really reach for a cup, although that's the layer we operate on; because underneath, certain muscle fibers are being contracted by neurons (which is beyond our perception)
   * in taijiquan (1-2 layer): abstract principle, of yin/yang (2) and idea of an activity (1)
   * feldenkrais for example, puts very much attention on layer 0, all the details and subtleties there
   * where is CI located...?
* metaphor of Asterix and Obelix (neuroscience):
 * Asterix makes the plans, like a fine pen/dagger
 * Obelix executes those plans, a primitive hammer
* the images we use to move our body, significantly changes the way we engage our muscles
* Chinese philosophical meta-physical concept of qi as a tool (an abstraction, yet not reality)
 * using it for our intention, to improve our movement execution
* intention is actually a rather short moment; not the whole movement execution is filled with it (but many different approaches there)
 * like a trigger of a pistol: the trigger is the intention; the bullet flying is filled with attention (no intention required)
 * the earlier we let go of intention once the trigger is pulled, we can go quicker into the attention state
   * if we punch with our fist throughout the whole flying through the air with intention, we don't realize (missing attention) that our opponent has already raised his defense shields and evaded our trajectory, and threw something against ages ago
   * while in a focus mode (focal point), we don't realize this (closed, tunnel vision; no open awareness)
     * focus mode also ignores the internal sensations; relevant to keeping balance
 * intention is like an ignition; can be released quickly again; similar to how we use muscle tension: build up and release quickly once more, to maintain lightness/gentleness
   * don't lead the movement, it won't be smooth; they are usually sloppy, or just edgy/jerky; too tight; not adaptable
 * a push is a lead movement until the end, but a thrown punch is lead only at the very beginning, then let go
   * within the martial arts concept of boxing, it can be considered as bad, as we need quick, explosive movements
   * within medical application, these intentionally led movements could be beneficial (relative/context)
   * within dance: lifting someone, leading movement is useful
   * the function/application determines what important/correct is
 * it starts with intention, followed by letting go, and finally the movement happens
   * letting go makes it easy to adapt
   * leading is control; controlling what we want to feel
   * to let go is to stick (adhesiveness) effortlessly to your partner; to lead is to actively need to chase him
     * adhesiveness, to follow effortlessly, without looking for it; like water: filling the space in between (mushin principle)
     * it happens through structure and the idea of movement and trained body quality
   * only big movements need slight correction occasionally
* general art might require intention as well, but what it requires more is dedication
 * like in zen: when you eat, you eat; when you sleep, you sleep; fully, with full attention; doing only one thing and one thing only, being in the present, not already planning the future or ruminating about the past; hold your horses, stay focused
 * when you practice, then it's like a fight; not like as in tensed up or hard-working or image being attacked...
   * but with the same attention and care with your movements, as it would be a question of life and death
 * and later, fight as if it would be practice/play; relaxed attention, like when playing; fearless, worry free, no over control
 * if overly attentive, it usually leads to over-control and tension
* the body's connective tissue is elastic, built from chains; thus there is a delay
 * we can't lift the finger; maybe we need to activate the bone structure/joint; or the surrounding tendon; whole forearm connected; perhaps first activate the shoulder/chest; ... infinite chain of movements; not consciously innervated
 * all happening automatically in the brain; its function to coordinate our body (un-/conscious actions)
   * it simplifies our body control on an extreme high abstraction level
 * it is said, if we needed to regulate the function of our liver just for a few moments, we would go crazy and then die immediately
   * even lifting a finger, fully consciously down to the neurons, it would be far too complex to compute consciously
   * not only energy inefficient, but it would bring us an eternity to do all that consciously
* yet, there is an approximation to do that, when practicing body awareness
 * e.g., when trying to change existing patterns; being aware, analyze, and then improve
 * trying to maintain balance; to lift arm without tensing up shoulder
* we can only understand our movement in terms of a overly simplified model (but never reality itself, also not meant to)
* taijiquan uses such a model, but not meant to be taken literally; doesn't happen for real in the body
* levels:
 * the lowest level: what's "really" happening? atomic/molecular level, proteins? neuromuscular? fiber contraction?
   * inaccessible to us, otherwise we would go crazy
 * mid-level: idea of a movement in the mind
 * the highest level: abstract principle; yin/yang (close/open); instead of the idea of punching, or muscle contraction
   * a model to learn how to move efficiently
   * at the beginning, yi (intention) is essential; without a direction (e.g., open), no clarity
   * not necessarily clarity about what to do, but to initiate the direction so that it happens what we are keen to do
     * e.g., "I want to push him" - "I would like to extend my arms, and maintain my CoM" - "I would like to reach the force over my back, while letting it go on the front side"
   * ultimately, reaching a state where we control the intention itself (everything is already connected with each other)
     * while practicing, the connection is from outside in
     * when we use yi, actions happen from inside out (simply think about the idea "open", the joints/connective tissue)
     * to mobilize the yi in a natural/proper way
     * taijiquan uses both directions, inwards/outwards; both qualities; two which are one; philosophy

3.2 how do you regulate your muscle tonality/tension during practice?
========================================================================================================================
* muscle tonality = amount of tension/contraction in the muscles
 * there is a default, baseline/norm tonality, we have, even when not engaged in movement; standing, and even when lying
* how can you practice more from within a healthy center? to be not too stiff nor too sloppy?
* we require a muscle tone; otherwise everything would collapse (homeostasis is balance, not in one or the other extreme)
 * to open from within, to expand, to be full; "fullness" in taijiquan is a form of tension
* to yield into gravity => to gain tension
* taijiquan uses more the concept of "body tension" instead of "muscle tension"
 * fascia, and tendons, yes, support a lot of tension; muscles only contract
 * (or do some muscles maintain tension? seems ineffective...)
 * holding tension = keeping up the muscle contraction; myofibrils (myosin+actin) require ATP to do their thing
 * doing so over a longer period of time makes sick; like when chronic stress (headache)
* the question is: how much body tension is necessary to support my structure, and thus keep balanced (the actual goal)
 * taijiquan uses an exaggerated practice of relaxation/release; extreme soft practice but without being sloppy
 * we try to "swing" ourselves into the healthy middle; most people are too tense, few are too sloppy (need more tension)
 * people differ in tissue and bones: being proportionally shorter/longer
   * some people are "constantly being stretched"; too big bones for short tendons; base level is high tension
   * that's not necessarily bad tension, as there is little/no holding tight (passive structure)
 * some people are hypermobile, tendons/connective tissue too loose, muscles need to compensate (active structure)
 * usually/interestingly, the too-loose-people experience more difficulties than the too-stiff-people to reach middle
   * middle = to release and yet stay stable
 * we need to acknowledge and respect our by-birth-given tendencies, and stay realistic with what's possible
* high tonality prevents us from moving suddenly and quickly; not being able to adapt; quick contractions are difficult
* low tonality people love standing meditation; tension is built up by trying not to tense up ;)
 * different kinds of tension: not activation of muscles/contraction, but more fasciae work (as when lying down)
 * fascia is more able to maintain tension over a longer period of time (muscles are not built for that)
* too long in the typical computer position, shoulders/chest/arms... tissue hardening/thickening...
* taijiquan tries to reach a minimum effort
* ultimate goal: find balance, distribute tension across the body
 * shift from where too much towards where too little
   * like in shiatsu and the theory of the "energy ball": we are always 100%, just not distributed well
   * or economy/wealth: there is enough; enough resources on the planet, but we have a distribution problem
 * the difficulty: to feel where is too much/too little
* when on the back too weak, the front is too strong; some areas of the body are too long, others are too short (via contraction)
* people with too much tension might need to stretch more, to create more space, make joints more movable
* there is nothing better than movement to release tension
 * to hold tension, and moving (conscious muscle activity) are counterparts
 * when tensing muscles, the tension in the rest of the connective tissue gets less
 * thus, muscle tone gets lower while moving
 * EMS (electro muscle stimulation) is different: muscles (during stimulation phase) are constantly activated
   * the other extreme, muscles totally relaxed, and everything done by connective tissue would also be too much
* there is no movement anymore; movement is not only staying silent
 * in taiji we try to find a balance; a sweet spot from where we can move and stay silent
 * the concept/quality of "peng" = elasticity, inflating capabilities
* a cyclic movement method is necessary, always coming back to this "collected state" (stable from within, attentively watching), and actively moving again
 * to constantly just sit (in front of the computer at work and at home) is an extreme and is healthy
 * and so is constantly just standing (despite that it's being promoted, standing desks) not healthy
 * it's not about one thing being perfect: standing, sitting, lying
   * it is about movement, constant change
   * many sophisticated people also agree here: "the best position (sitting) is the ever-changing position"
   * to listen (feel) to the body's needs and constantly adapt (nothing to measure in numbers, nothing absolute)
     * not to follow 8 hours of sleep, 10k steps, 2 liters water, and 90 degrees sitting; feel and adapt instead
 * too much activity exhausts, too much inactivity deteriorates; etc...

3.3 how much is physics important for taijiquan?
========================================================================================================================
* extended initial question:
 * or biomechanics/anatomy in a broader sense, and classical mechanics/gravity in a narrow sense?
 * do you use terms/concepts like vectors/momentum/centrifugal force/ballistic (throwing fist, explosiveness)/lever technique?
 * how about Chinese terminology of force/energy, a la peng/lu/ji/an...?
* just see how wonderful our human body is, what it can do, when trying to redo it yourself:
  * https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=boston+dynamics+atlas
     * how difficult it is, our daily human movements: try to redo it, tell a machine how to do it... amazingly difficult
* in dance, usually function follows form (function=effectiveness/efficiency/health; form=aesthetics/impress/express/looking good/performance/acting) VS expression (might not have aesthetics; modern dance/buto)
 * professional-competitive sports / martial arts: form follows function (goal is more pragmatic)
   * it has to work; what works is right
   * how to determine which is better? two people enter a room, one leaves, the other one is being carried out
* as physical objects (our human body) we obey physical laws; movement is mechanics; everything we do, thus, must ultimately be in alignment with physics
* taiji = natural principle; similar to physics
 * or "nature-o-logy" or "nature science" as it is literally translated from the Dutch language
 * a lot is based on observations of the nature and deduce general statements/laws/principles
   * Daoists observed nature, like water and its "behavior", and would generalize it to the laws of people and the universe
   * observing the change of the seasons (Wuxing, the 5 phases)
 * we humans share all an intuitive concept of physics; even if we can't be conscious about them and express them in formulas
* any form of movement (sports, dance, martial arts): we have to deal with gravity; a constant force affecting us
 * without gravity, no structure/adaption... we could all be like squids, without bones
   * even a squid needs to use his muscles efficiently to optimize movement
 * in space, we would need something different... impulse engine like...? spitting ink?! ;)
* physics is the foundation in taijiquan; helps with orientation in space
 * balance aligned how gravity pulls on us; depending on our individual body structure (joints, bones, tendons...)
 * additional complexity, as we were never supposed to be standing upright (bipedal rather evolutionary recent and adapted)
 * without tail, to stabilize balance, we need to be even more fine-grained in sensitivity/alignment
* how to deal with force; e.g., lifting weight is a rather complex movement (snatches with olympic bars); alignment, structure, dynamics, timing...
 * comment on that: is the goal A) to lift max mass or B) max the stimulus for the muscle/intensity
   * if A) efficiency in movement is the way, if B) then we deliberately imbalance ourselves, making it more difficult, less weight but higher intensity
 * is it also about aesthetics (body builder), to simply grow muscle mass? or is it about functional strength?
 * in any of these cases: they all use physics
* in martial arts (on the battlefield) we can't allow ourselves to be inefficient
 * in professional sports also not
 * in professional dance, sometimes aesthetics wins, and sacrifice physical effectiveness/efficiency
 * in dance: function follows form/aesthetics; with some exceptions (like abstract art maybe; or Japanese Butoh)
   * perhaps not about "looking good", but at least strong in expression (the essence of art maybe)
   * especially modern dance more expression; classical dance (ballet) more aesthetics (extended standing on toes!)
 * in martial arts: form follows function; application looks the least aesthetical
   maybe in demonstrations/performances (movies) it looks more pleasing for the eye; more about expression
 * similar with drawing/painting: the goal usually is "to look good"
* physics is also relevant when thinking about punching, throwing, ...
 * punching so that the fist comes back after throwing it
 * a paradox: to punch we need to tense up; to tense up means to contract; but to contract is the opposite of to extend, which is to punch
   * to only contract parts, like the triceps? no! as we need the fist to fly on a straight trajectory
 * more like a short, quick, explosive movement; ballistic process; immediately relaxed again after the "explosion"
 * the fists/arms are being thrown, instead of punching (and even less than pushing)
   * they are not constantly being moved/conducted, but only for a brief moment speed up and then let free
   * similar to sword fighting (Japanese Iaido); let it happen, let it flow, don't intervene too much (empty mind/mushin; raizen; dao/zen)
* lever techniques as well: fixate a joint to get leverage
 * simple physics; short/long leverages; target of the leverage; which/where fulcrum
 * which body parts used for leverage; which end of the leverage am i?
* everything that is in movement is physics
 * thus, everyone who is professional, and uses movement, benefits from knowledge about physics
 * what's force, energy; gravity; vector; momentum, inertia, impulse (state of motion of a mass); kinetic/potential energy, ...
   * constantly, through gravity, we have impulse available, connected with potential energy
   * those things should not be confused with each other
   * punching is not kinetic energy but impulse transference
     * using force (contraction) to change state of motion (arm travelling through space)
     * on impact, this force changes the other person's state of motion
 * different kinds of collisions (impact of objects):
   * (perfectly) elastic/inelastic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision
   * when two (human) bodies collide (a punch), then there is a collision
 * taijiquan practice aims to get closer to an elastic body
   * being "inflated and round", to be more like a ball
   * being able to receive and store incoming energy, without deformation
   * energy is "lost" through deformation, thus to preserve maximum energy (and give it back), we shall not deform on impact
   * deformation means not only losing structure/balance, but also injury
* moving a hand, without leading it, through intention: using the concept of ballistic, throwing; quick and dynamic (can be explosive, "fajing")
* leverage (in martial art application) could be very precisely calculated through physical formula
 * be always prepared on the battlefield with pen and paper and calculator ;)
 * to get an intuitive feeling for the optimal positions to use the maximum out of physical reality
* vector = direction + value (for us, usually force)
 * in taijiquan critical; when talking about yi (=intention), it needs direction (our -mental- vector)
 * the mind needs to know where to go; otherwise the body doesn't know too (it needs to align to a -given- direction)
 * very conscious taijiquan practice uses also the eyes (same with dance/CI: using eyes and head to steer in a direction)
 * good alignment requires clear yi/intention, then lots is possible; without it, things will go wrong; directions are important
   * direction of movement, direction of body/posture, relation of directions to someone else's
 * to read the other person, to be able to adapt, requires us to be aware of his direction (obviously in space, but also intention/mind)
   * to have certainty what the next move will be, the move will become clearer
 * there is always one vector present: gravity pulling downwards; on every particle of our physical body, constantly
   * sophisticated movement systems make use of this fact; to improve structure, to create/change movements
   * usage of it in floor work/rolling; follow gravity, yield/relax/give in to it
   * it often leads back to simply surrendering to gravitational pull, and everything happens by itself
 * in taijiquan, people stand very low; to go low is not very difficult, but to stay very low is ;)
   * elastic connective tissue will be able to use this stored (potential) energy, while going down, to get up again, or use/redirect it in another way

3.4 CI has a practice called "small dance"; how does it relate to taijiquan's/qigong's standing meditation? what is its aim?
========================================================================================================================
* "small dance" = being aware of unconscious micro movements to stay balanced/upright
* micro-movements/distortions in balance; breathing, heartbeat, even thinking!
* to be more sensitive, fine-tuned (higher resolution in awareness); more nuanced/differentiated
 * smaller parts; focused/magnified/zoomed; to be correct/exact/precise
* zhan zhuang (qi gong) - standing meditation; to stand like a pillar
 * to move in extremely small room; a dynamic balance (not a static one); not holding, being stiff in a posture (it's an illusion from the outside of stillness)
 * the goal is to be more aware, to feel more those subtleties in the body (not only micro-movements to balance, but also tension, etc...)
 * the more sensitive, the bigger (subjective, internally) become these subtle movements (from outside it looks more and more still over time, smaller/compact/finer)
 * don't try to "go away", that's something else; big corrections to evade some discomfort
* balancing micro-movements strongest to be felt in the legs, especially ankles
* the goal of standing meditation in taijiquan is not to "look/move prettier" (aesthetics), but to be more stable
 * to activate tension more on the inside, more internal, thus being able to relax more outside/on the surface => iron bar, wrapped with cotton wool
* zhan zhuang provides a schema: a base-line/zero-line; to know where is the plus and minus relative to that state
 * what is neutrality, not opening/closing, not bending/flexing, ... every direction would require activity
 * the non-activeness is the meditative aspect of this exercise; learn through observation (despite small corrections in alignment)
 * no correction is possible without observation first; and a direction going towards to (goal); feel/observe again after correction
   * but also don't stay continuously correcting, searching for something...
   * have a small break after a correction to pause/rest, and give space to observe/for awareness, for information retrieval, interpretation
* goal: to figure out the middle, neutrality; to be able to determine which side of the middle we are
 * to be more fine-grained with it, so movements/adaptations can be more sensitive/fine/small
 * pushing-listening exercise, at the beginning mere muscle act; later, a matter of pure sensitivity
 * it's about refinement, scratching of the edges, making the ball round and smooth (not only in movement, but also in standing)
 * to be able to decide nuances like to shift the weight by only 2 grams/millimeters; very tiny rotations of the shoulder, to always be centered
 * to not be wasteful, but more precise by an increased awareness/sensitivity
* refinement... nuanced/differentiated... zoomed in/magnified (not rough)
 * to be able to move in smaller space and time as the opponent; less space and time required to achieve the same (efficiency)
 * it is (relatively) faster, as the movement is directed and requires minimum; similar to the concept of elegance (no unnecessary movement)
* yet the movements still stay visible; there is no "magical non-movement" happening; but the mechanics are very fine
 * like the gears of a Swiss watch: a small movement of one gear, can have a big impact on a huge gear/the system in total
* the "inner space movement" is small (joints), the "outer space movement" is big (kinesphere)
* small dance: to know internal movement patterns; to know oneself; to be able to use those
 * being able to feel how gravity pulls on me in the most subtleties (and its impact on my structure), then also usable in relatively bigger movements
 * a mental warm-up, a body-scan, to be more self-aware
 * a transition from small-dance to big-dance: to amplify the subtleties into bigger movements, expanding them, and letting them lead the movement (passively)
   * a source of inspiration/creativity, by gently supporting them; magnifying them
   * like in taijiquan: gravity pulls me, anatomically based biomechanics dictates a certain movement, and I will comply with it (nature)
* some repositioning of the joints is so tiny that it is (almost) impossible to consciously try to be aware of them, but we can feel them (using direction/intention)

3.5 how important is "pathway continuation" in taijiquan? how is it being practiced?
========================================================================================================================
* pathway continuation, or: maintaining/continuation of the movement direction; inertia, momentum, anticipation
 * to maintain the dynamics of the movement
 * unrestrained letting it flow, in a never-ending circle, without a beginning and an ending
   * in partner exercises, continuously changing yin/yang, giving/receiving, attacking/defending, a dialogue
 * everything done in one dynamic, one big (over-)arching movement; like in music (different notes, but one bow over it, connecting them all)
* it's a shock to the nervous system (annoying?!) if movement is unpredictable; jerky; breaking the pattern
 * be like a circle (ball) and less like a zigzag rabbit hopping around
 * inertia: a jerky movement will require a lot of (wasted) energy to execute, compared to a naturally rounded one
 * without a set/fixed intention; breaks, and hard resets/restarts; without holding on
* it is very difficult for beginner to acquire that skill
 * also due to the order of the curriculum: first, the basic movement patterns have to be acquired, and then we can go to flowy movements (pathway continuation)
   * first build up basic repertoire: standing, shifting weight, steps/footwork, bending/folding-opening/closing, spine work
* in taijiquan, weapon training helps to acquire the skill: a saber, as it is round (less a sword), or a (heavy) spear, forcing not to do jerky movements
 * through the weight of the weapon, it has to be more of a round movement (otherwise fighting against inertia, it gets exhausting)
* from this constant flow of movement, potential intention is concealed if you want to suddenly deliberately WANT to change the direction
 * out of the smoothness of circular movement, maintaining contact...
* taijiquan, as a martial art, we would rather not waste energy; not wanting to build it up if not required
 * making the other work for me, that he is moving me, using his energy for my own advantage (needing less energy myself)
 * trying not to be an obstacle to the opponent's force

3.6 how does taijiquan implement spirals? how are they similar/different from CI's interpretation?
========================================================================================================================
* within taijiquan differences of emphasis on spiral movements
 * popular yang style is simplified, fewer spirals; Chen style mainly spirals
 * Chen style puts silk-reeling exercises in focus of practice (spiraling whole body as one unit)
* where do spirals start from? where do they go through? which planes?
* spirals even present anatomically in our bodies (muscle structures)
 * thus, arms/legs want to rotate based on how they are built
 * thus, there appears to be a physical justification for the naturalness/rightness of spiral movements (myofascial chains)
* difference rotation/spiral:
 * extremities (hands) or center (core/pelvis) are leading the movement
 * it depends... perspective; every movement can be viewed as such that the hand is leading
 * we want to move the hand; thus we reorganize the "body behind it" so that the hand can do its thing
 * yet, in principle, taijiquan moves from the center outwards (especially old styles)
 * in taijiquan: rotations AND spirals being from the center
   * a rotation moves the pelvis (like a full turn of the body)
     * rotation of the spine/torso; hip joints in relation to the upper body stays constant (moving like a "block")
     * the stance (legs) is of course different
   * purpose of rotation: to change the direction, to adapt the posture/stance (rarely for an application)
* spirals...
 * happening between center and extremities
 * the movement pushes outwards: it is inside smaller than the outside
 * a 3-dimensional movement: a circular aspect, which expands into space
 * e.g., starts (in old Chen style) lower small, and gets bigger when moving upwards
 * avoid dissecting the hand from the body; creating tension and resistance
   * exception maybe during an exercise/application, and the partner grabs and turns my hand; the spiral begins from outside
   * thus, spirals are moved inwards when they are passive
* rotation...
 * everything is turning like in one unit together
 * if the shoulders move, and the pelvis as well: that's not a spiral, but a rotation
* taijiquan knows two (closely related) movement principles: spirals and waves (different in dimensions)
 * everything is a vibration, either circular (spiral) or wave-shaped
 * an oscillating pattern on a sheet of paper is a very limited view, as movement is 3-dimensional
   * in 3D, we would say many circles which move in space (a continuous curve, a spiral)
 * a wave is operating in a lower dimension, in 2: up/down, forward/back
* spirals are better in neutralizing energy (compared to going directly against)
 * evading incoming force is also possible, but requires lots of time and space
 * the lower part moves a little, the upper body part more, shoulder/arms evaded already
 * when being encountered with lots of linear force against my own, then spirals are perfectly matching to penetrate that resistance
 * spirals are very efficient; energy-saving; using more the torso (where there are more muscles/strength), and less the arms/legs (weaker parts)
   * if the opponent approaches with whole body, we need to counter as well with whole body (not only hand/arm)
* a rotation could be considered as a single segment of a spiral
* a spiral can store plenty of incoming force, like a spring (PS: it's actually a helix shape ;)
 * physically a perfect shape to store energy, and also to release it
* "good kungfu looks bad, only bad kungfu looks good" (movie stars, ineffective, show, performance, aesthetics)
 * true to a certain extent; yet, taiji classics state: practice boxing shall not be done without an artistic skill
 * wushu (=martial arts) is more than just fighting; it's a fighting "art" (not a fighting system)
   * kungfu = a way of doing things (but we say it wrong, as otherwise people don't understand us)
 * Hakka boxing (like wing chun, chu gar gao) not considered as real wushu
 * if it is truly a wushu style, then the aesthetical aspect is indeed considered
 * many styles are created to train soldiers quickly in times of war, thus disregarding the aesthetic aspect totally
 * wushu usually has a long tradition; almost like knights in feudal times; a bit like an art skill
 * the less traditional styles also have an advantage in being more effective
 * if the wushu (the movement in general) is "good", then it will be (as a side effect) also "good-looking"
   * if adhering the flow of nature, like in physics (gravity, spirals), adhering human body's nature (anatomy, biomechanics); to find the path of least resistance
   * the intention is still not on aesthetics; the danger of doing so, it will become an (ineffective) dance form, to pleasure the eye
 * being aligned with nature is always regarded as attractive/aesthetical
 * in the "zhuangzi" (daoistic classic), it is stated that there is a "naturalness of acting/man/nature/dao"
   * everything has its dao (=method); if a man tries to be like a machine, he loses that naturalness (and also aesthetics)
   * if my actions are not in alignment with my anatomic givens (with two arms), and try to move like a scorpion, it will not look aesthetical
   * it might be even externally considered as aesthetical by some, but it loses its internal naturalness
   * to bring that internal aesthetic (nature) to the outside
   * in CI, in improvisation in general, improvised acts come from inside out
   * to express oneself through movement; in the professional domain, people express other people's expressions by following choreographed movements
     * just like actors: there is a script, still the way it is specifically acted out (implemented) is colored by the actor/artist doing/executing it
     * there is always at least a tiny bit of personality, his uniqueness, added to the formalized notation of the script
