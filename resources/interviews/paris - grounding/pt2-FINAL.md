PART 2: partner connection
   

2.1 what and how do you read/feel in another person; while in direct contact / in distance? what do you consider?
========================================================================================================================

UPFRONT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* feeling whether someone is grounded; whether just stuff or truly soft-strong
* lot to do with intuitive feeling, unconscious processing of vast amount of information
  * better to "let go"; let "it" do it, not be too conscious
  * too little time to consciously process (get info via looking; first contact and shortly before punch; ...)
* how to apply martial art skills in partner dance which are more free/improvised (less salsa/tango, more lindy/zouk)
  * considering taijiquan is more competitive, and dance collaborative
* to get this intuition: do we need to work/train hard for it (experience), or is it given by birth?

* in distance:
  * reading a person (un/conscious), nothing to do with "aura feeling", but solely visual input
  * body posture: his intention (aggressive, ready to attack, hesitating, calm)
  * structure: grounded/rooted, within own center of mass, weaknesses (e.g. injuries)
  * range: how far does he get with a step (length of leg, charged jumping leg)
* in direct contact:
  * intention: feeling the push before it is being executed
  * structure: like in distance; smallest deviations of balance can be felt
    * even breath can be reveal something (keep the breath in the dantien, otherwise center of mass lifted with every exhale; this way, an attack can be easily anticipated, when someone inhales strongly to exert force)
  * force direction: where does it come from/want to go to
  * force quality: explosive, constant pressure, strong/weak
  * body quality: body hardened/stiff or soft
  * shifting of weight or rooting
  * immediate sensation whether other has better/worse roots
* lot do with empathy; to put myself into your shoes
  * we can't look inside the other, but through experience, we learn to recognize certain patterns
  * based on my own body, or past experiences with others
  * determine the quality of their structure/alignment/grounding; minor issues/tension in body parts
* psychological: which state is he? aggressive/fear? relevant in a fight situation?
  * the posture of fear: general tension (more than necessary), CoM high, protective shape (rounded, shoulders inwards, head down, protecting the front/neck/vulnerable parts, offering the back/more robust/shields; tilt pelvis forward)
    * also happening with stress symptoms; related to fear
  * fear is just one step away from aggression
    * a calm person is less aggressive because he isn't afraid
    * aggressiveness is usually a 2ndary emotion, covering up fear; a protective measure, defense; to feel threatened, injustice, not entitled
  * the other extreme, totally open, offensive posture
    * also fear, just "escape forward" instead back (flight response)
* by being "bombarded" by sensory input, and subconscious perception, it will be aggregated, resulting to an "intuitive feeling"; without conscious analysis
  * basically forming an impression, built on all our past experiences and matching the pattern within ourselves (running a simulation)
* when there is touch, we realize faster the other's intention
  * not relying on "tendencies" anymore; e.g. seeing fear is not a guarantee, but a tendency of potential physical violence
  * before a punch, there is a slight tension before which can be trained to be receptive to it
    * a simple inhale can be revealing (synchronizing with the breath of the other)
    * that's why part of taijiquan training is to hide one's own breath from the outside (mask our intention, not being able to be read, act incognito)
      * if the breath is in the lower belly, the chest stays empty, and the arms don't reveal our intention (preparation); e.g. through mixing common and inversed breath
* touch is essential in taijiquan, as we get information we need to read intention
  * information e.g.: hesitant, offensive; reading structure; 
  * belly/chest/back engaged when applying pressure; can you feel the legs/feet/ground underneath? reading internal connection of him
  * if the structure is weak, we can easily break it
* thus, breath is important
* force direction and force quality:
  * where does the other come from, where does he want to go? reading vectors?
  * being able to interrupt his action, in the very last moment, not giving him a chance to adapt
  * to feel when he is uncertain, jerky movements; not really knowing where to
    * has no plan, or no method, or not sensitive (not knowing which direction the right one is; speaking of leadership)
    * out of desperateness (not knowing better), randomly tries something, no determined force
      * easy to overcome that person, with a bit of rooting and adaptability
  * some people are very tight, holding on, pressing, tensed
    * elbows push into his own body; leaning, unbalanced
  * when the other is producing explosive force, suddenly lots of power generated through the floor, whole body
    * immediately know (sense) to get out of the way ("weg ist das ziel")
  * to gain information requires time; time we get through grounding/sinking/elastic structure
  * not only feeling movements of the arms/upper body, but also lower
    * whether someone is changing distance; fill the space on retreat, move back when too aggressively rushes forward
  * arms are not that important in taijiquan for observation, more about the center and the lower parts
    * well-trained arms protect almost automatically with a good method and a habit (pattern) of being in the right spot at the right moment
      * e.g. not just dropping both arms, or extending both forward, so there is no defense left (basics)
  * know right away who is stronger/more stable; can i "over-yin" (playing satellite, fine-sensitive, technique) "over-yang" (rough "tank" sufficient) him
* parts of intention is able to be perceived through touch
  * we can't read minds, we cant know what the other had for breakfast (maybe smell it though)
* although ultimately taijiquan is about fighting (self-defence, overcoming the opponent)
  * it is not about winning, but about connection (connection leads to success)
  * "to give up on yourself", letting go (ego/wanting); becoming as observer, adapting
  * rather passively being moved by the moment and the partner; not doing, but realizing potential (mushin)
  * being in contact, to communicate; exchange forces/kinetic energy; a punch is a question we can respond to
  * it's a discussion which can escalate to a struggle/fight, but doesn't have to be
  * he wants to fight, but i don't respond with counter-aggression
    * when he uses brute force, but i don't reply with hardness/stiffness
    * when he tries to grab, but there is nothing firm to be grabbed
    * to be like a mirror, and the other might lose interest, as "it takes two to tango"
* dance and taijiquan is different though when working with centers
  * in partner dance (collaborative) we might want to support the partner when feeling that he is not grounded
  * in a fighting situation, we try to unbalance the other, destroy his center and groundedness (while protecting and hiding our own)
  * in both, we want to connect our centers, gain information, and work from the core
  * if you have the basic skill underneath, you can use it for any purpose - the two underneath being one 
* the method, and what we do though, is based on the same aspects
  * the feeling necessary to manipulate structure of the other (whether to improve or dismantle)
* chinese expression to describe certain movements/movement qualities:
  * peng, lu, ji, an; an = push (sometimes also pushing downwards)
* (artificial) exercises, a choreography, a routine/framework; let yourself be guided
  * as in karate (Gichin Funakoshi) they say: form always the same, when applied never the same
  * when more advanced, able to let go of that routine (exercise); more improvised
* things happen so quickly, in a fight and also an improvised dance
  * impossible to consciously process all the information
  * better rely on unconscious processing of all the subtleties (visual cues, mirror neurons, micro-expressions; possibly molecules in the air via smell), and let it communicate to you through "a feeling" (jedi skill)
  * when you "feel energies", nothing more (according to current understanding of reality) than that unconscious processing power
  * we need to let go of consciously understanding, mental effort, being aware of the why reasons, and just "go with the flow"; trust gut-feeling (let the universe/dao guide your movements); intuition
  * that skill, those interpretations can be trained only when practicing slowly (then also maybe being more aware of them); in the application those things usually disappear under the surface
  * the more advanced, the less a concrete idea will exist on what to do, and the more guided based on skill and experience
    * to have no idea, no plan; only focus to maintain center, connection, and feel... easy to adapt, even when things go very fast
    * only difficult, when trying to mentally comprehend and having fixed ideas (what to do next, wanting!)
  * as a teacher, difficult to demonstrate, as there will be a wanting, a fixed idea on what to do, thus often won't work (forcing it); won't be able to get the right quality; a paradox
* practice together, create an as natural as possible situation to practice something
  * of course it's an artificially created laboratory situation, still...
  * work together WITH your partner, thinking about what to give, so he can practice the appropriate receiving method
  * some students (deliberately? unconsciously?) want to make it as difficult as possible for their partners
    * ego expression of showing one's strength? but none will be able to practice properly
    * giver: too tensed up wanting, wanting to win; no technique, no quality
    * as receiver: more about survival, not losing, whereas growth is wanted instead

2.2 what is "sensing the other person's center" and how to achieve it?
========================================================================================================================

* similar to above...
* it is possible to sense the whole movement-state of the other person
  * it is possible to figure out the center of mass of the other person
  * "the one who controls the center of the other, does not need to fight"
* moving in someone's negative space; without touch contact
  * through looking definitely possible
  * also through peripheral vision (unconscious processing again)
* through practice, also possible to read very quickly people you see on the street
  * being able to evaluate "yes, this person has a strong stance"; develop a feeling for it
  * it is involuntarily, there is no way to prevent it from happening; we "must" process that info, creating a feeling/felt sensation
  * we use our own body as a reference, to infer how the internal structure looks like (in a certain position)
  * at least roughly it is clear where the CoM is, by only visual cues; good first impression at least
* it is possible to sense the CoM (with eyes closed) and only a touch on the forearm, yes, BUT:
  * it requires that the partner is giving some kind of force (like leaning, or pushing)
    * for center connection, a certain oomph-quality is necessary
  * AS: an empty hand/arm doesn't give any information (useful to apply in fighting situation)
  * "empty hand": no connection from hand to center; no "channel" (medium) to read through it


2.3 what does "shared center of mass" mean, and does it have any relevance in taijiquan?
========================================================================================================================

UPFRONT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* building bridges: to connect two (wrestling) people
  * to be connected with the other: "shared grounding"
  * we avoid "leaning on the other person" (same as in CI)
  * not always possible to avoid, but definitely not preferred in taijiquan
* rather prefer to maintain one's own center, and offer the opponent instead the song kai structure (as support to lean on)
  * he will move his CoM in direction that contact point
  * one's own CoM stays in dantien though
  * if you take away that support, he loses his balance for a moment, enabling time to execute an action
  * "only when you can control your own CoM, you can conquer someone else's CoM"
    * to enter someone else's yard and claim it as one's own
  * the other person will feel immediately uncomfortable and unstable; desire to fight/movitation decreases
* if both have a shared CoM, no one can be "empty", without danger of losing one's balance
  if one uses too much weight/force, danger of falling to the floor together

TRANSCRIPT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* in taijiquan, we try NOT to build a shared-center though! (in contrast to CI)
  * although a bit it will happen anyway...
  * we want to maintain our own CoM; by relaxing/song/grounding
  * if other puts his weight on your center, that you still have control over the situation
  * in wrestling/judo, the centers are put on top of each other, so they don't have an own CoM anymore
    * the goal is to go to the ground anyway; to fall onto the other and dominate him there
* traditional taijiquan, the body is upright (and not lent forward)
  * legs might be a bit more exposed/in danger, but take that risk to maintain one's CoM
  * need to be quick, flexible; not too much grounding, as costs our adaptability
    * there are exceptions though, for a short moment, to apply it as a tool; just as "empty hands" technique
* when people in CI learn grounding, this often leads to stiffness/rigidity at the beginning; exaggerated
  * when having to take a step, it's like a tower falling over; lightness missing to stay flexible
  * in european taijiquan community still like this, that this is the desired goal
    * china is different; more focus on "feeling the force"
  * again: don't focus on the floor/feet, but on the lower belly, to avoid stiffness in grounding
    * legs need to be light, agile, mobile; also potential to root; to quickly take all weight in
* we ground, yes; we lean, yes on our own center (not the partner's)
  * through gravity, everything is stacked; leaning vertically on each other
  * it's more like an idea, not (physical) reality
    * it's not like the belly is the center and the legs float around in air
    * there is a gradient, tension lower (legs) higher than upper (arms)
    * the center is the gateway, where force is directed through, connecting down-up/legs-arms
  * for beginners it can be helpful though to allow them to lean on the partner at first
    * to avoid getting in a pure muscle strength battle; more about feeling of/adjusting to directions
    * to have these experiences of things follow smoothly by themselves
    * when we tense up, we get rigid, we feel less; and even if we feel, we are to stiff to do something
  * when people get unbalanced, they have the tendency to tense up even more, making it worse
    * instead of letting go ("ins verlieren investieren"), the only situation; drop, sink, relax
  * during practice, we avoid leaning on each other; in application/reality it still happens sometimes
    * e.g. a natural "counter-leaning"
* to hide oneself (oneselves center), through disconnection (or uni-directional connection), essential in fighting
  * in dance, the opposite is the case: we want to connect, open, obvious, visible
  * things are more visible in the chest, shoulders and arms
* mechanics/method of dance and martial arts not that different
  * CoM outside or inside; in Taijiquan keeping it inside, stay firm, using ground to receive/expel force
  * e.g. climbing: CoM needs to be relocated somewhere else; hanging upside, better have the CoM in the chest
  * e.g. balancing/slack lining: two small centers, more above (big pole), gives more time to react
    * working only with very small movements (otherwise balance gone)
    * the longer the pole for balance (walking ropes over canyon walking), the more fine-tuned the rebalancing



2.4 does taijiquan work with "kinesthetic resonance"?
========================================================================================================================

UPFRONT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* something like: empathy, mirror neurons, intuitive imitations, feel what other feel
  * mirror: to do the same, or do the opposite, but for sure connected/impacted, react on other's acts
* being strategic (chess), to put yourself in his shoes (predict/anticipate), choose appropriate actions
* mirroring is a very efficient method in fighting
  * not expressing aggression, but staying calm
  * that's demotivating for the other, and maybe he loses interest to fight (unconscious mirroring)
  * "an avoided fight is a won fight"
* through adapting the external movement, we mirror the other, and pretend to let him the lead
  * not much effort is required, and aggression calms down
  * as: who wants to keep on fishing for the other permanently?
  * the one who gives up himself deliberately, can also be active at any time
* intuition and empathy are very important aspects in every fighting system
  * does the other actually want to fight? how does the other touch you?
  * once it gets fast/rushed/dangerous, we can't always trust our own observation
  * if you stay calm, and "collected", you have time to sense
    * outwards, into the other; and inwards, inside oneself
    * then, the correct reaction will come, totally by itself

TRANSCRIPT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* empathy, mirroring (mirror neurons), imitating...
  * when seeing someone else, i (unconsciously/automatically) imitate, i feel inside, and project that inner feeling onto the other
  * that's how we know how the other feels (empathy)
  * something esoteric people sometimes (due to lack of better knowledge) call "to feel the other's energy"
  * this copying goes way back when we were children, and observed our caregivers
    * we use imitation as children to learn; to adapt to our environment, to establish social connections (important for our survival, as dependent children)
  * some basic emotions seem to have a universal/cross-cultural (thus genetical base) in how it is expressed in body/face
    * thus, we have an innate, automatic (unconscious) feeling for some expressed emotions of others ("feeling his energy")
  * the evaluation of the other person's state, can only be based on one's own experience
    * additionally we could learn theoretically about those things; as we might do when studying about body language
* taijiquan doesn't use this specific term, but it's all the time about establishing connection (distance or touch)
* to adapt (to fit in) means connection, without connection no adaptation; no adaptation when ignoring the environment
  * empathy is a conclusion back to oneself (mitfuehlen = "feel with"); relies on one's own experience
  * empathy is not external but internal; only an external observation, with which we resonate with (can compare/pattern matching), because we were in the same/similar situation
* in taijiquan, we try to be a mirror to the opponent; it is very hard to attack a mirror
  * to either literally mirror, or a more abstract adaptation as a complement to his movements
  * the idea of a mirror: he is offensive, i am defensive; he is hard, i am soft (the daoistic taiji philosophy of yin and yang)
  * it is a form a strategy on how to deal with any situation: in a fight, in games (chess, go), sports (ball/team), romantic relationship, business (negotiations), ...
    * e.g. imagine you have to play a board game you don't know, how to maximize chances to win (or at least not lose quickly): simply mirror the other person's moves
* in martial arts/wushu/budo (taijiquan, aikido) it is NOT about winning; it's not a sport
  * in fighting sports (boxing, MMA) it is indeed about winning, ego, competing, hierarchie, comparison; infinite exploitation of own resources for a never ending growth (like economy is doing these days) 
  * it's about not to lose (not to get injured, to not die), it's defense
    * not about to injury/kill the other (this might be a necessary side-effect, a necessity to survive; but that's not the primary goal)
    * in the past, martial arts were used for military use (systema, grav maga), where offense and destruction of the enemy was indeed the main purpose; but not anymore (weapons, rockets, drones)
  * in aikido, we go one step further: no enemy, no opponent; just trying that neither of us gets injured, while the other tries to attack me
  * "an avoided fight is a won fight" -makes much sense now considering this aspect
    * to run away, to de-escalate, to calm the situation down... all a "win" in that sense
* in martial arts psychology is a very aspect
  * every good martial artist has a good sense for the other person (un/consciously reading faces)
  * requires empathy: to put myself in the other person shoes, and thus anticipating the next move (strategic advantage)
  * not to be taken literally: i don't feel the physical pain of the other, but... to have sophisticated guesses about the other's rough state/intentions
  * thus: strategic games (like chess and go) help sharpen these required skills; empathize, predict, adapt
    * also during a fight, or a dance, or a conventional discussion...
    * don't just immediately do something, but wait a moment
  * instead of immediately replying with resistance/a "no", but receive from the center
    * allows for empathy; why does he say that (even if totally irrational; independent of being true/correct)
    * usually the underlying reasons have little/nothing to do with me; no need to (verbally) talk back
  * who of us didn't have a shitty day and we were grumpy and ventilated on (innocent) others? and even worse: they would fight back, not being able to see what's really going on (of course not, as we are not transparent beings)
    * that's of course an ideal, we can try to strive for, but we are humans, and being human means suffering
    * "Life is not easy. Life is very harsh. We have to be strong. Otherwise, life will destroy us."
    * "Do you want to have an easy life? Then always stay with the herd and lose yourself in the herd." - Nietzsche
* 

2.5 how much do you see/experience a relation between personality and body characteristics?
========================================================================================================================

UPFRONT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* personality traits, as in: mis-/trust, risk-taking/-aversion, patience/restlessness, ...
* body characteristics, as in: muscle tension, movement patterns, etc
* in chinese martial arts (wushu) it is said that it's fairly easy to guess which style someone is practicing, by someone's character
  * many external styles (wei-jia; like shaolin kungfu, or modern karate) use aggression as a driving force to overcome fear and physical limits
    * those people show usually also a fiery temperament/elbow attitude in their daily life
    * center of their personality is success/achievement/winning
    * win will the one which is stronger and faster, tougher, more aggressive; has its limits, and decreases by age
  * internal style (neijia; like taijiquan, baguazhang)
    * nourish calmness, relaxation, letting go; not faster/stronger, but more adaptable/flexible (yet maintaining minimum effort, a appropriate amount of brute muscle force)
    * the one who is more sensitive will win; no limits, even in old age; yet way more difficult to achieve, takes more time, and especially less developed in the beginning
    * those people are usually calm, friendly, and have no strong opinion; sometimes a lack of ambition
    * they choose their battles, let go where not important; they can be stubborn when it's important to them
* what we do, shapes us; the way we are shaped defines what we do (chicken-egg problem)
* different training shapes the body-mind differently
  * body posture has a strong interaction with the mind; bidirectional effect
  * reading body posture: is someone curious, shy, unsatisfied, negative
  * with age, those things can also be read in the face; but the body talks much earlier

TRANSCRIPT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* mind-body connection is bi-directional (ultimately one, but for human simplified reasons we consider them as separate)
  * we can see in a body: trust, patience, fear, joy... posture, tension, movement pace/quality
  * this reading skill is usually automatic, and especially unconscious
    * as a teacher, this needs to be a bit more conscious; to be aware and work with it, verbalize it
* not so much about personality, it's a smaller part, not so fundamental
  * more about how live life, experiences, activities
  * our environment, parents, peers; role models, gender-stereotypical imitation
  * we can also influence/partly choose our environment (work, friends; esp. as an adult), thus shape ourselves indirectly
* in china: when people train martial arts properly, with dedication (only few do that), one can see which style based on their character
  * wing chun/xingyiquan: very direct, using elbows to get what they want, ruthlessness; successful/effective approach (in our society)
  * taijiquan/baguazhang: "whatever" type, useless people in our society, no edges, don't need to go against and rebel; live in their own little bubble, own (psychological) center; safety in oneself, not having to prove, just feel/know
* bodybuilder have a firm structure, but also rigid
  * difficulty grounding; relaxing chest and arms
  * the bigger the muscles, the more difficult it is for them to keep the arms on shoulder height for longer period of time
* other extreme: people who do nothing physical, sit in front of a screen at work and at home
  * much movement comes from the wrists (instead from the center); stiff shoulders; no arm-body connection
  * still can be efficient/minimalistic
* old people: fine motor skills developed; based on experience know their own body better
  * although not being professionals... that's maybe why taijiquan masters are usually old: it requires time to feel your body, to get to know it; being more and more
  * it's about being economically; young people are wasteful (they have enough, but don't move/live efficiently)
* temporal other direction: not only past influences my present... can my present movement practice influence/shape my personal state of being/my environment even?
  * yes, that's what happened to me; first aggressive as a young, and external martial arts made me even more aggressive
  * taijiquan made me calmer, relieve from aggressiveness, less being annoyed/bothered by things
  * BUT: chicken-egg problem: maybe my personality has chosen taijiquan?
    * we prefer to choose what is known to us; difficult to break out of a circle/pattern
    * e.g. always choosing the same romantic partner, leading to the same harmful situation, because that's what we saw as a child; unconsciously prefer to stay in the comfort zone; if we want to break that pattern, we usually rationalize why not.
  * we cannot change ourselves, from within ourselves though; we can change what we do, what we surround ourselves, that changes our thoughts/expectations
    * merely meditating, and imagining what we would like to be; thoughts/feelings/words don't matter, acts do
      * compassionate loving kindness meditation... might has its right to exist, but not sufficient in itself
      * daily meditation practice is great, but keeping it there is useless, waste of time; real meditation is real life
      * in spiritual community, many methods are abused for escaping reality, not to improve it
      * meditation helps us to be more aware, connect to ourselves, and potentially gives us insight how to act better from a place of mindfulness; to reach an ultimate state of objectivity, transcend our human ego being; to see and know when/what/where is right
        * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziran => also see chapter mastery
      * meditation is not bad, but the way it is wrongly done; it is possible to do the same with taijiquan: doing it once a week for 1 hour, won't change much, useless; although it is promoted often being so healthy, but... commercialized, superficial, no real essence, no effectiveness
    * "Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one." marcus aurelius
  * most of the people don't like themselves, but they also don't want to change themselves/lifestyle/their environment
    * but want that the problem want to be solved; have difficulties with endurance/persistence/commitment
      * once the feeling of change arises, they get scared, and drop it/run away (and rationalize their decision to maintain self-esteem, to lie to oneself and feel comfortable; confirmation bias)
  * taiji principle: everything is constantly changing
    * learning to let go, give in; go with, adapt (just as in dancing as a follower)
    * this WILL change personality, yes, for sure. but it requires time
  * practicing taijiquan becomes truly useful/worth the investment, if it goes beyond the practice itself, and changes your life
    * "karate doesn't start when entering the dojo, and doesn't end when leaving it"
    * practice your grounding while in a stressful situation with someone; or do you lose your center and get stressed out?
    * can you let go when the other tries to convince me of something i don't agree with? can i just listen, or do i immediately push against (without even listening, out of habit)?
    * we all are human, we all do that and have our blind spots; but with diligent practice they can become less (in frequency and severity)
  * taijiquan is for sure healthy as a movement practice, but the real value lies much deeper and is much bigger/impactful
