- implicit norms; how to behave (do/not do)
- focus on principles (easy, listed) and bit technical; for sure safety
- focus on psychology (confidence) and social (finding partner); be aware of projections (saying yes/no)
- less history
- highlight on words "contact" and "improvisation"
    - improvisation is doing without a plan
- "if it's too rushed, there is no space to listen"; patience, resisting "the feeling of not doing enough"; like this awkward silence when no one is talking in a conversation
- feminine (round, holistic, together, feel; principles) vs masculine (reductionism, analytical, sturctured, think, language; techniques): finding balance within both; western cultures more masculine; beginners need more masculine; CI is more feminine
- anatomy useful; for communication (vocabulary); knowing joints/structures, to be aware when moving (where is what); inner image to visualize; to prevent injuries (in martial arts use it other way round)
- ad physics: understanding is necessary, at least embodied; intellectual is of advantage
- social, starting dance: eye contact; how to send/receive signals; when it naturally happens (use tom's... gravitation pull); "frechheit siegt"; the decision makes itself; don't use excuses (lieing)
    - projectino joing existing duo (are you annoyed yourself)
- consent needs to be explicitly expressed in CI; more than in any other dance
- beginners want structure, like in salsa; not just "rolling on the ground" fuzzy
- male/female: in CI we depersonalize, at least that's the goal. no men/women anymore. like in tantra: have both inside of you, to have polarity in any dance.
@tom: the tantra 1-5 exercise, does it mean in CI we are constantly in each other's bed?!
- non-verbal communication: we can all talk at the same time, and still hear each other (like standing in a circle, all moving, we all impact each other); in CI, in a duo, we both talk and listen at the same time
- ad motto: "watching is also participating"; with presence though (not on your phone), as an active witness; during jam/workshop/class; get inspiration
