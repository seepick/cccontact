* send out mails/contact to ~20 different CI teachers (all around the world, big ones; check book authors, CI global calendar; ask tom)
* ask if they want to ask some (about 5) questions
* if yes, then send those questions (like tom) to be answered and incorporate the answers
* they can answer via text or a voice message (i will transcribe it)
* introduce myself just a bit; my passion for CI, what it did to me; state reason being: "my own personal research"
* give some praise (ego stroking), a la carnegie's "what's in there for me"
* questions like:
    1) what is CI? definition (technical, narrative, image)? relate to {dance, sports, ...}? how's different/what's unique about it?
    2) what are (core) principles, common techniques, make it distinct, within (otherwise outside/doing something else), rules/norms
    3) what helps a beginner? common mistakes? safety rules for survival? how to help them in a dance, during it, as an advanced?
    4) what makes a seasoned CI practitioner different/good? qualities, skills, attitude, mindset of an expert of CI? how to spot one (visually)?
    5) last question: if asked to give inspirational speech to a crowd of 10k CI enthusiasts, what'd say?
