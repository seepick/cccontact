what makes a good dance? (INTERVIEW with pau)
======================================================================================================================
* title:
    * a good CI-practitioner a good CI-practitioner?
    * an enjoyable/pleasant/satisfiable CI interaction?
    * what are the skills of an experienced contacter?
* personal VS technical: of course, technical can be compensated by personal; e.g. XYZ i don't like, but because i like her, XYZ doesn't bother me
* many things are not set in stone/absolute rules; people are different (generally and also in the moment/situation), the relations with people are different (good friend vs. stranger)
    * follow gut-feeling, intuition; observe carefully (upfront; body language, posture)
    * the skill of feeling the boundaries of the other
* takes time to make initial contact: from space in the room, to negative space, to contact
    * having made himself noticeable upfront; eye contact, smile, smalltalk... (bit trust/familiarity)
    * reading people in the space (before the class, warm up; how they walk)
    * starting already further away, how much time to reach closer in personal space
        * if rushed, feels aggressive; if too slow, feels insecure and strange (odd; unsafe; unnatural... edgy)
        * eye contact? maybe too invasive; for beginners sometimes necessary maybe (plus smiling); too long/staring definitely bad
            * similar with approach too frontal (confrontational); from behind also bad; when safety necessary: my back to hers
            * maybe diagonal (not from front/back), with my side directing to her (not my front)
            * e.g. approaching and making contact someone from behind; risky, but with some even ok, and they like it. for others a shock, trauma invoking.
    * receptive to consider signals received when approaching (reacting to them)
        * when i retreat, he retreats, or at least stays; my boundaries are being respected (image of a cautious cat)
        * mirroring (not necessarily mirror/imitate, but influenced by it), acknowledging each other (not being ignored), creating sympathy
    * adjusting/attune to each other's quality (grammar/language/dialect), finding common space/speed/quality; be on same wavelength
        * the slowest/lowest dictates the speed/skill; faster adjusts to slower; high-skilled adjusts to low-skilled (slowest walk at the front of the group)
        * don't just throw people in the air (acrobatics, grabbing, no autonomy, without an accepted invitation)
            * some people seem to be restless (it's in their personality); doing/wanting/acting; forced and too fast => know and express your boundaries
    * in general, touch first with back (upper body back), back2back, or sides (shoulder), or back-side of arm/hand (not palm)
* slow... slow in approach in room/negative space; slow when touching; maybe even stand still; breath a moment
    * motto: "it can almost never be too slow, it can always be too fast though"
    * to feel we need to go slow, to go deep we need to go even slower (like in tantra/sexuality; take time to feel boundary, what's ok; time to feel and take decisions)
    * once we know each other, found/met each other (can be also very quick; with presence and sensitivity; flow established), we can go faster and faster, and the sky is the limit
        * has my partner the principles (grounding/sharing weight, rolling point of contact, pathway continuation) embodied? (CI specific experience/skill)
            * the skill of checking/testing your partner as quickly as possible
* motto: "when in doubt, always play it safe" (when in doubt, it's a no)
* during the dance:
    * pure technique not so much important...
        * even a CI-beginner without any specific techniques, but with general body skill (embodiment, awareness, precision, strength, balance) can be super nice
            * "hard body skill"/masculine: technical skill, strength, speed, courage (risk-wanting)
            * "soft body skills"/feminine (embodiment): awareness, sensitivity, softness, listening (feeling for one's body; segmentation, precision); afraid/risk-averse
        * general body skill > CI skill (principles) > CI techniques (lifts)
    * relaxation in the body, yet firm/grounded ("soft yet strong"); breathing
        * trust necessary to relax, to ground; lack of trust, fear (wanting to control; holding); intention (meta level) of how we use muscle strength (gespannt aber nicht verspannt); closed muscles
    * creativity:
        * the "wow" effect, when "it" happens, without me/you/us doing it. improvisation, surprise (ourselves/each other; surrender to the moment/trust), when things emerge and letting go of doing something new. breaking patterns. together. "unvorhergesehenes"
            * e.g. ask 2 people to draw something together on a single sheet of paper; without them knowing what they intended
            * e.g. improvisation acting, when both say one word, how the story gets created
        * not staying too much/too strictly with CI technical paradigm/dogma; working with what is
    * trust, predictability (without too much forced control)
    * the mysterious oomph quality; support, sharing weight, ...
