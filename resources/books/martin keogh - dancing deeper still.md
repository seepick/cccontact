ABOUT
========================================================================================================================
* the book:
    * an ongoing inquiry
    * catching moments, an instant rather than a doctrine
    * my love letter to that practice

DEFINITION
========================================================================================================================
* like fire, it's in motion, it's mercurial (sprunghaft, wechselhaft)
* contact jams: usually weekly
    * also: "labs" to research
    * sometimes dancing in city parks

HISTORY
========================================================================================================================
* "Touchdown Dance", organization using CI with blind people
    * see: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1290603
    * originators did not codify the dance, not becoming the "CI police"; but allowing to grow organically

MOTTO
========================================================================================================================
* "there is no rush, there is nowhere to go, there is nothing that has to be done."
    * usually trying to squeeze maximum as possible in a day; constant rush/stressed! never enough
    * simply hearing this is enough for us to begin to relax
    * hear the sighs, observe the shoulders dropping
* "do less"
    * we usually want too much; as students (especially at the beginning) and teachers; as children and parents
* "the art of waiting", being comfortable in silence, with stillness; nothing to do, nowhere to go
    * in the middle of the hurricane of activity, there is a quiet eye
    * waiting = available/ready, look forward eagerly, rest in expectation, a sign of respect
        * from old high german: "wachton", to be wide awake
        * act of waiting = act of soaring (aufsteigend), in readiness, eyes wide open
    * find a position during your dance and just stay and observe
    * observe your inner voice "you have to do something, otherwise he will think you are boring"
    * winnie pooh said: "Doing nothing often leads to the very best of something"
* centering/grounding useful skills to build self-trust; here we meet in the breadth/depths of who we are

MOTIVATION
========================================================================================================================
* experience time passing in a kinesthetic (instead of conceptual) way
    * keeping explorations experiential, based in sensations
* we so often follow practices because someone told us that it's supposed to be "good for us"
    * sitting in silence, meditation, not liking it, aching knees and back, hating life, but it's supposed to be good for us
    * going to the gym, because we are too fat, hate our bodies, so we enter the chamber of torture, because it's supposed to be good for us
    * we do yoga, because we are too stiff, we need to be more flexible, and it's supposed to be good for us
    * ... why de we beat ourselves up so much? how can you find the pathway of ease?
        * a "joyful endeavor" like children: they play, have fun, forget time/themselves, and have a workout as a side effect
        * this is, what CI is to me: just playing around, exploration, curiosity... no workout, not healthy, not deep, not "supposed to be good for me"; keep it simple

PRINCIPLE
========================================================================================================================

GROUNDING (centering)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* the first thing you'd do to prepare yourself (physically and emotionally)
* coming home to yourself
* feel the relationship and constant influence of gravity
* required for developing responsiveness
* first need firmness in our feet, then confidence being off balance / unpredictability of shared centers
* acquired by returning to the core; staying centered in more uncontrolled/chaotic conditions
* like a granite mountain, like the earth is breathing us; gravity is pulling from below and also pushing us from above
  * puts us kinesthetically in our center; sense of support/held between two forces (rather than one)
* why learn centering/grounding? to improvise. to have the basis to take risks.
  * dilemma though: those qualities can make people rigid
  * it's only a stepping stone to build trust (for more dynamic situations)
  * need to build a relationship with gravity, supports us when off-balance/during flight
  * that connection must stay alive/sensitive
* more advanced people evolve from centered to polycentric
  * body parts start to move autonomously, like an octopus
  * putting themselves off-center, not knowing where it will lead to next
  * spirals, extending past the body; fall and rise simultaneously
  * bravely improvising (out of control); taking grounding less preciously: to ground in fear/excitement/imagination/paradox
* weight exchange: momentum, entropy, centirfugal force; sub-worlds of arches, apexes, arcs, under-arcs
* beginners have feet wide, anticipation supporting someone's weight; creating firm stability
  * more advanced have a more narrow stance, in order to be able to respond more quickly; being more light-footed/adaptable/ready
  * when holding a weight with extended arms, much heavier then when held close to your body
    * same with catching: going with its trajectory much easier than a "cold stop"
    * the body needs to be ready/mobile; relax, narrow stance, breathe
    * better to deal with large masses, from a fluid/multi-centered place, than a grounded one
* imagine gravity not only pulling from below, but also pushing from above; finally, coming from every direction; sphere of force = spherical gravity

EMPTY MIND
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* let go of willful control
  * let the animal brain & body have a stornger voice
  * an inner dictator might demand resolution which is fixed and unchanging
    * he wants a single picture of the river; rather letting the river flow
  * how to increase capacity to live in the unresolved
  * accept the ambiguity of existence; fluid, active, filled with unresolvable contradictions
    * the ego's willful demand for a logically consistent system
* we do not _will_ our movement along, but rather _allow_ velocity to move us; finding that rhythm

QUALITIY/ATTITUDE/MASTERY
========================================================================================================================
* desired internal state: aware, present
* how to ground yourself (mindfulness/awareness exercises; footnote: join a 8-week MBSR course if you want):
    * listening to sounds, without labeling
    * breath through mouth and nose at the same time
    * practice the CI "small dance"
    * slow, soft, self-caress
    * awareness of transition between ex-/inhale
    * ... the senses awaken and open; creating willingness to stay engaged in sensation as we go into movement
* follow through, rather than throwing in new impulses
  * * capacity for staying in disorientation, by follow through rather re-center (even when off balance, up high) 

CONSENT
========================================================================================================================
* saying "no" in CI; boundaries and trust
* first need to build capacity for trust with ourselves, and then with partner/others
* nurture/harm that by in/ability to set/respect boundaries
  * if someone else crosses expressed boundaries (if not expressed, he didn't know, not a boundary crossing)
    * also: someone can hardly cross my boundaries, it's usually me not setting them properly (or even communicating them)
  * if my partner doesn't express boundaries (saying "no", but "yes" all the time), trust can't be established
  * TODO: see brene brown: anatomy of trust, BRAVING
* i rather have an honest no than a dishonest yest
* situations that may arise:
  * how do you let people know that you still need to warm up? or to end a dance? when having physical limitations (injury)?
  * what to do with insensitive partners?
  * jealousy, when your partner has a sensual dance with someone (vulnerability)?
  * musicians forget about the dancers and are in their own bubble, disconnected; how to interfer? when people park on the dancefloor? chat too loudly? emotional catharsis/tantric/ecstatic dance people?
  * how to communicate/negotiate those boundaries? most importantly: don't police, but ask.
    * everybody is welcome, but not every behavior
    * the rules are made by the group, observe them and their behavior, not by you, or by the book
    * if agreements have been set upfront, execute them nevertheless, otherwise no trust due to non-reliability (integrity)
    * dare to be blunt and direct; e.g. partner with rash, ask: "is this contagious", instead of running away in cowardness/disgust; have courage, show love, overcome your fear
  * when saying "no" to someone, maybe check-in with them later, whether it was communicated clearly and gracefully
* you can only have the trust/capacity for a full yes, when you have the ability/confidence to say no
  * physical skills to be explored when: touch (move hand away), dance, lifted (drop weight, move center away), weight exchange, momentum, manipulation...
  * but also in verbal circumstances
* robert bly, author of the book "a little book on the human shadow": the dark side of the human personality -- and the importance of confronting it.
  * we have a door in our psyche
  * as children, the doorknob is on the outside; people come in and go as they want
    * adults feed us, wipe our butts, carry us around
  * as adults, we move the doorknob to the inside
    * we choose when/for whom open/close the door
    * if we have the power to close the door, we feel more free to open it, and invite people inside
* some people have body/boundary issues; difficult/challenging to connect/feel sensations in their body
  * boundaries were splintered as children; build a protective shield/armor/wall, prevents full contact with themselves and others/the world
  * most important now to develop boundary-setting skills, trust in themselves, move the doorknob inside; express limits; soften the armor, invite people in again
  * i need to keep myself safe, from here i can care for the group
* start by saying one-syllable words: stop. back. wait. (maybe not "no" as it is too rich in nuances)
  * also nice to redirect attention, where there might be pain: knee. ankle. neck.
* every encounter is a testing of what is consensual: accept weight? how fast? can we go very, very slow?
* jams have an ongoing negotation of boundaries
  * how much structure needed? how much emotional catharsis welcome? music desired?
  * solution is always to listen empathetically, and not immediately try to convince each other from one's own opinion
    * then finding a balance between opposing desires
  * the more open disagreement, the more sincere/tearful grattitude there will be

SEXUALITY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* dancing with some people is like dancing with an overly enthusiastic puppy, trying to hump your shins all the time
  * trying to "get something off" on the dance; stealing something that wasn't offered
  * usually, people silently avoid that person, not giving honest feedback; no one saying something directly to him
  * him, starting to feel sad, as he is being collectively excluded, not knowing what's wrong
  * it's easy (and cowardish) to silently do that as a group, it takes courage and a strong heart to address it directly, with compassion and care, staying connected and genuinely trying to make everyone feel welcome, still maintaining healthy boundaries so everyone can express and feel safe (all needs being met, and adjusting strategies to satisfy them)
  * STORY: tiger and thorn in his paw; easy to not inflict pain by doing nothing (and he dies), or go into the danger of pulling it out (and saving him from death from infection)
  * if approached directly ("get your sexual desires under control"), he might appologize and change his behavior
    * maybe gather a few men, telling him how they perceive his behavior; harming the community; making him understand (not punish!)
    * that person might still come back decades later
    * sometimes it doesn't work though, then people never return again
  * sometimes even teachers show harmful behavior ==> SEE section beginning/teacher
* sexuality is messy, will always be an issue in CI community
  * sometimes jams have jam rule documents set up
* better to address these potential issues BEFORE they escelate (have strength, wisdom, courage, and sensitivity)
* have dedicated assistants for that; "vigil-auntie", or "resource people", for emotional support
  * maybe they have a background as therapists
  * topics like boundary crossing to loneliness
* steve paxton said: "CI is not a gland game", meaning not sexual dance
  * people say: "I love CI because it's a non-sexual way to be physical/affectionate and playful with people"
  * i hosted non-sexual/sensual cuddle workshops to explore the innocence and purity of touch
    * to not know who is touching; to touch without knowing who and what bodypart it is
    * to experience the pleasure of touch itself, without the stories being attached to it
    * amazing, how quickly strangers can connect so deeply when they feel safe and open up, how nourishing; we social animals we
* BUT: we are also sexual beings; do never suppress that biological fact
  * as when pushed down in the shadows it will have more power over us, in a stronger and unconscious way
  * more so true for men than for women (parental investment theory; men are more easygoing with sex and their sexuality quicker arises -and also disappears, to be fair)
  * be aware of it, acknowledge it, but don't act it out; give it some ventilation somewhere else, where appropriate, welcome and wanted; by yourself or with others
  * don't cut that essential part of yourself off; don't close it down; it's like mindfulness meditation: it's not about not thinking, but acknowledging the thoughts without engaging with them too much
* surrender to it instead, keep sexuality alive
  * occasionally two practitioners consensually bring in erotic/seductive behavior; test each other what's welcome for both; requires a lot of sensitivity/listening skill
  * going very slowly, making every move clear (its intention) and make it thus reversible for the other (giving space, allowing him to say no if necessary)
  * 

TEACHERS / CLASSES
========================================================================================================================
* some CI teachers travel around the world, touring, to "spread the word"; sleeping at strange places; homes, cheap; chaos, low payment... but they love it ;)
* sometimes male teachers abuse their power as an authority
  * picking the most beautiful female student to demonstrate close pelvis connected manipulations
  * a good teacher uses random partners; asks passively for volunteers
  * using a wide range of people: old/young, attractive/ugly, male/female, beginner/advanced
* teachers often take down the clock in the room: get out of clock time (chronos) and enter body time (cairos)
  * we usually "see" time moving in one direction; makes movement linear/symmetrical, less spherical/multifaceted
  * changing perception of time from visual to kinesthetic
  * find the pace where movement becomes effortless (we too often measure success by effortfulness/degree of exhaustion)
* rewarding for a teacher:
  * seeing students capacity for sensation/risk increasing
  * move less with an ideal, but more with the partner


SKILL / TECHNICAL
========================================================================================================================
* when being lifted, flying upside down => adrenals at full throttle


MASTERY
========================================================================================================================


UNSORTED
========================================================================================================================
* partnering:
    * complexities of relationships; expectations/judgments/reactions
    * difficult to keep awareness; first: slow down
    * slow down internally, reach a state where you can kinesthetically experience the movements with the partner
* ad safety: as a professional dancer, better get a good health insurance, as CI is not safe
* how to break habitual patterns/ways, how we initiate physical contact during CI: teaching your own style to your partner
  * then engage with your partner with his own style; a good pattern-breaker
