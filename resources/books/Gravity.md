Gravity
by Steve Paxton

* birth, an abrupt change, different factors than those in the womb, and there is gravity
* gravity, a natural force... our conscious memories of negotiations with gravity start rather later (5 years)
* the globe of perception, we are each the center
* the geometry of aerobatics (just bodies instead of airplanes; thus: "bodatics", or "somatics"?)
  * "aeroplane" and "acrobatics"
  * acrobatics: greek 'akrobatéō' = walk on tiptoe, strut
* oddly missing in our pantheons: the god of gravity
* gravity allows us to measure, a steady force
* imposes regularity on things we notice
* other senses: constant variations; incidents, shifts, modulations, silences/blinks.
  * gravity just keeps on attracting
  * any variation, comes from each element in its field, including ourselves
* human walking, each move begins with a touch-down upon the surface of the earth
* when walking out of the studio, we usually forget to be conscious of our movements
  * // karate: dojo, enter/leave, stop/start
* what is my body doing when i am not conscious of it?
  * to answer it, means to be conscious about it, thus impossible
  * not just physiological inquiry, but appraisal (=judge its value) of different states of consciousness, accompany different activities
  * a frontal attack on the unconscious
  * trying to catch myself behaving unconsciously, ruined by turning on my consciousness to it
  * spying on myself, self-hacking
* dancers must hack their basic movement programs in order to adapt to new movements
* we are usually taught dance by repetition; watching and imitating
  * a circular conversation, conservative situation; guide to cultural expectations
  * large mirror usually in studios, help for adjustment (peek, correct, look right)
    * sensation of movement add up to the movement they have been given
  * musculoskeletal sensations necessary for negotiations with gravity
* the finer units of time we perceive, the smaller the containers of consciousness we can experience
  * by being slower than our normal thought/action, giving mind time to step out of habitual/practical relations to events
  * consciousness can be formed/reformed; its parameters will adjust to conditions and conditioning
* there are 26 human senses (J.J. Gibson, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems)
  * it's difficult to find out what we don't know
* small-dance guiding talk:
  * standing; butt heavy, relax internal organs down in bowl of pelvis
    * breathe easy; feel weight of arms
    * observe small movements; reflexive actions
    * watch yourself standing
    * shoulder blades heavy, buttocks heavy
  * smallest stretch you can feel, direction of your arms; release; make it smaller, bare initiation
    * go past fingertips
    * where stretch started? arm, shoulder?
  * smallest stretch of your spine; coccyx, sacrum, lumbar, thoracic, cervical, atlas, between ears; release; smaller?!
  * imagine, but don't do it: taking steps, left/right foot
  * feel the movement of the diaphragm
* meditation practice: examining the body space for 3 days; roaming systematically, 1-point of view, analogous to vision
  * try to do with 2 points; works best if they are symmetrical
  * then try to do whole body at once
  * consciousness: a tendency to focus
* what to do with habits? we try to improvise, choose to move in new ways
  * passions; desire to be somewhere else, someplace specific
  * non-conscious mind does all this calculating
* habitual pathways
* orientation; we know space and our relation to it via the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear
  * if spin until dizzy, feels like a turning world after stopped spinning; sensation not felt in the inner ear though!
    * instead, stance/stomach will be affected
  * like in an aerospace spinning chair, head slightly side-ways, stimulating forward/back aspect of semicircular canals and acceleration
    * when stop now, sensation of being shot forward, although sitting still in chair; flying body and at the same time sitting body
  * both no inner ear sensation, simply whole body flying, with fear and adrenalin; great; nice phantom experience
* aikido:
  * connecting with one's weight
    * requiring less effort (than usual); below level of voluntary muscle contraction, preliminary state, preparing for action
    * joints/state stimulated, readied for action
  * Ki: quality and potential of connections
    * active in an ideokinetic way, as an image-effect, influence course in which events might develop
    * potential of the principle of "extension", source/radiation of energy within the body
* spherical space; mass of the body, weight, water... we're 70% water
  * body's prime sense of its own 3-dimensionality
* when two bodies meet, center of mass is shared between the two units; becoming one unit (in a way, relative to gravity)
  * as long as involved in leaning/giving weight, changing weight/orientation, relative to each other, they have one shared operative center
* time, as internal sensation of movement; "the chronosphere"; the space of time (or: time of space)
  * different from vision, light only reveals see-able exterior
  * chronosphere reveals the transparency of everything
    * thus, duality of interior/exterior irrelevant
* you have been swimming in gravity since the day you were born. every cell knows where down is. easily forgotten. your mass and the earth's mass calling to each other.
