// intention: clarity about expectations (avoid misunderstandings/disappointments on both sides)

* give them a printed copy for free (motivate them, ben franklin's tactic)
* they make notes inside book; i borrow temporarily to incorporate it...
* ad form: template to provide feedback FOR EVERY chapter (to ensure enough length!)

========


thank you for taking time to review my book, your effort is much appreciated.
in order to clarify expectations, so that your help is as useful as possible, here are some general pointers:

* please use the following form, the questions and sections, to provide feedback
* send back a plain text file (no word, pdf, or anything with formatting, no audio file)
* please only agree doing this if you can make the necessary time investment (=commitment), otherwise i will be waiting for you and instead could have asked someone else
* state what precisely you consider as bad and why, explaining the (possible) disadvantage, and provide an alternative on how to do it be better instead
* please be aware and highlight your personal preferences versus more objective remarks

1) general impression: very high-level, abstract overall gut-feeling
2) typos: spelling/grammar, capitalization
3) punctuation: usage of parenthesis "()", comma ",", dash "-", semicolon ";" (preferably with page/line reference)
4) language: clear, self-explanatory terms used, difficult domain-specific terms explained in glossary
5) style: easy to read, sentence structure/complexity/length, paragraphs semantically cohesive, word repetition
6) eloquence: too simply adjectives (e.g. nice, good) or too difficult ones?
7) order: of chapters makes sense, proper build-up, red thread following
8) content: is text in chapter fitting or better in another (existing/new one)
9) design: drawings, layout remarks, "text grey"
10) images: can additional images/figures help better understanding?
