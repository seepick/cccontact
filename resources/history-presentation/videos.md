INTRO
========================================================================================================================
* the following videos...
  * give a look at CI from its inception
  * track a period of exploration/discovery through documents of performances by its founding practitioners
  * they are not training tapes
* you need to see those first moments as a rough brainstorming:
  * a lot of shit collected too, but that's the whole purpose of brainstorming, non-judgmental just blurp everything out there is
  * only then later, selected, filtered, distilled and further developed; where we are today
  * please don't stick 100% to what you see; just because it's older (it's "more authentic") it doesn't mean that it's better (as in: more sophisticated)
  * what we have today is way more thought through and more advanced (like cars; or software; usually the newer, the better)

THE VIDEOS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* wild, throwing, dropping, chaos: "not knowing what's going to happen next"
  * way more free, less predictable, and more improvised than we are today
  * also: less aesthetics and technical than most are today; back then, they really explored the moment (in maybe a radical way)
* what you will see is a "fun exercise":
  * everybody in turn runs and throws themselves at this person, who would try to catch them and somehow manage the weight
  * of course they were trained professionals, had a mat, and a spotter (guardian angel)
  * those people are well trained; strong, flexible, have good sense of balance; they can do rolls, handstands, bridges (full back bends); most of the people doing CI are old, crippled, and weak. thus, the system became weak, for disabled people. it is limited considerably.
* all videos (performances) seem not to have a typical theater/professional audience character; more like a practice place, a jam
* they were more "socially welcoming, inclusive, open" then we are today:
  * they have proper trios, not like we do these days: 2 + 1
  * they float around, more fluid, engage and disengage quicker (interactions last shorter)
  * reminds me of dance improvisation: people walking/running/rolling alone, bump into someone, interact, and leave again; less of a "duet commitment" which ought not to be disturbed (closed, opposed to back then open)
  * maybe has to do that we dance in permanent contact, and they have more space in between
* in none of the videos, there will be MUSIC
  * a clear decision, well argued reason why music is not beneficial (see nancy's statement)
  * one exception: live, "interactive" drummer
* most videos are edited (not one continuous, 1-shot recording)
  * the nice pieces have been picked (like on instagram)
  * the necessities in-between invisible (like in movies, you never see them having to go to the toilet)
  * the failing/the ugly techniques taken out/censored; distorted view on reality (like instagram)

THEN AND NOW
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* in general, compared to today:
  * more solos
  * more (wild) acrobatics (impactful, fast)
    * more lifts; shoulder lifts; upside down; and staying on the body, not touching the ground but continue playing "in the air"
  * more grab/pull/push
  * more theater (acting, drama; less dance)
  * professionals with skills
  * more skin (sleeveless shirts; sometimes short pants or topless)
  * no music

Magnesium
========================================================================================================================
* duration: 9:33
* WHEN? January 1972
* WHERE? Oberlin College
* WHO? Steve Paxton, Curt Siddall, John Faichney, Chris Peck, Peter Walsh, Doug Winter, and more

About
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* "THE seminal work for Contact Improvisation"
  * "a high energy study" as called by steve once
  * a performance of steve and 11 male students
* at the Grand Union residency at Oberlin College
  * gym with a large wrestling mat
  * the audience looking down onto them, "into the pit, like in rome to the gladiators"
* a result of the 2 classes Steve taught at Oberlin college
* Nancy / Lisa Nelson said: "During a Grand Union residency at Oberlin College in January 1972, Steve Paxton made a work for 11 men in which they threw, caught, flung, collided and fell among one another continuously for 10 minutes. The dance was called 'Magnesium'"
* Steve said: "Essentially a lot of crashing around on a mat – followed by lifts of randomly chosen sacrifice... And then there was a five-minute stand. Out of all that chaos came – it would not be called order – but quiet"
* recorded (by mere luck) by Steve Christiansen
  * A man came to Oberlin to videotape the Grand Union performances and accidentally videotaped Magnesium, thinking it was the Grand Union
  * Steve invited him again to record later in summer 72 as well (chute)
  * early days of video recording: video was just becoming portable; cumbersome but portable

Content
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* people jumping (onto each other), rolling (ove reach other) and falling and grabbing (holding hands/forearms)
  * jumping into each other and colliding mid-air, yet landing softly
  * pushing each other over, lifting/carrying (duette or more)
  * well... actually, they mostly fall (and roll) / drop (dead) to the ground
* going in circles while holding arms; going up and down (stand, lie)
* all in moderate speed, yet a "soft impact" achieved; round movements
  * this initial style of CI exploration is known for its "survive skills"
  * a lot of hard bumps as well, and unannounced jumps on each other
  * no sign of rolling point of contact, (almost) no sign of sharing weight
  * more counter balancing and pulling
* looking very playful and explorative; like children on a playground
* several mats on the ground; yet some practice on the wooden floor
* people are watching from the upper audience tribune (somewhere there is nancy as well)
  * some people sit on the edges of the room (dancers taking a break?)
* interaction seems like one of a regular jam; but super very short dances
  * everyone with everyone, no designated couples, going in and out arbitrarily
  * half doing a solo, other in couples; sometimes trios; rarely some form of "cuddle puddle"
* last 2mins the infamous standing meditation ("small dance")


Chute
========================================================================================================================
* duration: 9:30
* WHEN? June 1972 (1979 documentary made)
  * "a hot day, but everybody seemed gay"
* WHERE? in NYC at John Weber Gallery
* WHO? 15 people
  * performed by people from: N.Y.C., Univ. of Rochester, Oberlin College, and Bennington College
  * Steve Paxton, Danny Lepkoff, Nancy Stark Smith, Curt Siddall, Nita Little, Emily Siege, Laura Chapman...
    * ..., Barbara Dilley, David Woodberry, Mark Petersen, Leon Felder, Tim Butler, Tom Hast, Mary Fulkerson

About
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* a narrated documentary of the performance named: "1st Contact Improvisation Performances"
  * first CI demonstration; showing its development, the first seeds
* organized by Steve Paxton, an exchange gathering, experiences related to CI 
* practiced on a big mat (just like magnesium)
* 10mins excerpt of 75 hours recording (by Steve Christiansen again; edited with Lisa Nelson)
  * those are the trainings for the performance (the other performers sitting around, watching)
* narrated by steve
  * 7 years after it happened, the view itself is influenced by its development until then
  * even 1979, the original seemed "wild and woolly, raw energy meeting itself head-on, automatic reflexes getting a thorough workout"
  * walking is a gentle way of continuous falling (CoM in front of us; opposed to in taijiquan)
  * sloughed falls, horizontal falls, accidents, falling up, falling down, controlled falls, free falls, "splats", ...
* see full video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FeSDsmIeHA OR https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaIWwn4-LZ4
 
Content
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* different people collapsing, being caught, and rolling together
* high level of attention of the partners; focus is visible
* breaking our sacred "pyjama dress code", and even dancing half naked (only shorts)
* acrobatics; strong; and flexible (backbends)
* sequences of "i'm throwing myself on you, catch!"
* some "fear-shock-screams" hearable, due to the risky moves; but also plenty of laughter
* maintain handstand balance, to play around your partner on the ground (in a safe and connected way)
* a bit more looking for (maintaining) connection
* at the end: small dance
* sometimes still looks like wrestling; against each other, instead of together

Narration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* a continuum: standing (small dance), falling of walking, bigger jumps on bodies
* all about "impact play"; initial contact point after fall, used as a lever
* transforming sudden accidents into controlled decents
* skin as a 360 eye: in all directions, all at once (like non-verbal communication in movement, a group at the same time; opposed to using spoken words)
  * through habitation, skin perception is usually not entering consciousness (feeling your underwear?)
* momentum can be used, once initial impact shock is absorbed/deflected
  * when a man jumps on a woman, most of the "solutions" end on the floor ;)
  * don't catch or hold weight -> dangerous
* preparation needs to be made in the first instance to guide a roll // "amat victoria curam" = "victory loves preparation"
* safety: not committing to what's not happening
* open state of mind (jedi skill), as everything is happening so fast, that conscious mind can't follow anymore
* turning falling skills into muscle memories (important for survival!)
* difference children-adults when they fall: adults' mass is greater in relation to their structural strength, thus more likely to injure; but: learn to slide, roll, fall, full surface landings (spread impact); see martial arts; transform vertical into horizontal movement
* "Contractive energy or tensions overpower the sensing of subtle movement, and so gravity is masked." (tension masks sensation); relaxed, but not flaccid
* if you can't remember what you have danced (mentally or bodily) then you did it right ;)


Peripheral Vision
========================================================================================================================
* duration: 21min
* WHEN? recorded 1973 (commentary done 1975)
* WHERE? Firehouse Theater in San Francisco, CA
* WHO?
  * Performers: Steve Christiansen (recorded magnesium+chute), Steve Paxton, Nita Little, Nancy Stark Smith, Karen Radler
  * Commentary: Steve Paxton, Nancy Stark Smith, Steve Christiansen
* WHAT? a seminal work; performance/concert; with comments
  * the show is called: "You Come, We'll Show You What We Do."

Content
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* parts shown twice: first slowly, then in real time; commentaries from the dancers themselves, being able to talk also about their inner experience during the recording/performance 
* this time without mats; and seemingly more audience around
* looks like beginners trying with CI for the first time (clumsy, unsophisticated, not smooth)
  * lots of bumps, hard falls (impact, little elephants); instead of sharing weight, the totally lean into the partner; looks more like acrobatics
  * grabbing, interlocking (leverage/support), bad gorillas, ... many things we'd consider "bad" today
* pulling hands while one on the ground, turning around... common technique, also in magnesium
* 0-6: steve and steve
* 6-12: nancy and karen; trying a quick trio, but fail to do so and stop
  * seems more like improvisation acting/dance improv.; "female approach to CI" (less wild/lifts)
* 12-21: nancy and paxton
  * seeing familiar techniques like "wings" and "seat belts" for support; little animals and superman
  * some wonderful moments which very much resemble what we know CI for today (more smoothness, control, connection)
  * before "falling into each other", often can catch how they are looking "where is my partner currently"

Commentary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* more back rolls (less rolling on the front): can take/give more weight, but also less personal
* "rational thought is too slow": same as with close quarter combat; even visual cues processing is too slow; we need physical cues/instincts/reflexes
* calling "the base" = "the carrier/holder"
  * emphasize importance of center-alignment: bone taking the weight (bone-structure/architecture), the muscles only guide (they don't carry)
* when engaging a trio, the social aspect becomes way more emphasized/focused; we pay way more attention to it, as the social creatures we are
* way to land properly is to continue (not stopping) the movement; saying "yes", not "no" (fear, resistance)
* the value of pauses, an opportunity for new directions
* watching CI recordings in slow-motion, lots of details will be revealed // same as when moving slowly ;)

Soft Pallet
========================================================================================================================
* duration: 17min
* WHEN? recorded 1973; published/commentary in 1979
* WHERE? Rome at L'Attico Gallery
* WHO?
  * Performers: Steve Paxton, Nancy Stark Smith, Danny Lepkoff, Annette LaRoque, David Woodberry, Mary Fulkerson
  * Camera: Steve Christiansen
* WHAT? a seminal work; performance/concert
  * the title comes from (so i guess) the fact they dance on some straw mats, which the lay on the ground, as shown in the video (beginning, and passages all throughout the whole video)
  * seems more like a private gathering (jam) to explore; not like a concert/performance

Content
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 0-2: setting up the floor; some solo people
* 2-5: two guys, looks a bit like wrestling/capoera; wildly jumping on each other; mostly no physical connection; at the end cosy playful weight/support play
* 5-7: two ladies, more gentle/slow; same as in peripheral vision: women do the "head dance"
* 7-10: two couples (different genders), one more in the foreground (nancy and...?); nice, continuous rolling happening there; also a bit more wild (losing connection); free to "pedipulate"
* 10-14: two guys, natural mode of: wild, throwing, survival; quite a lot of "bouncy rodeo moves"; lots of control/softness/sensitivity shown here (despite the fast, risky moves); at the end much slower, their breath hearable
* 14-17: ... damaged/lost


Contact at 10th and 2nd
========================================================================================================================
* duration: 48min
* WHEN? 1983
* WHERE? "Danspace", St. Mark's Church in N.Y.C.
* WHO? 7 (20?) seasoned performers (US, UK, Canada): steve paxton, nancy stark smith, david appel, robin feld, alan ptashek, peter ryan, kirstie simson
  * video: lisa nelson recorded and edited (recording with 2 helpers)
* WHAT? 11th anniversary concert
* https://contactquarterly.com/contact-editions/title/contact-at-10th-and-2nd-(1983)#$

Content
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* recorded in color (first time); in big room, wooden floor; no music (as usual)
* people barefoot and dance clothes
* walking, laughing; solos/duos/trios/group; very short interactions
* much softer looking than the other videos (10 years later), much more what we have today
* it seems to me, the reason why it works so well for them ("looking nice") is, because they dare to push into each other
  * know when to support, fearlessly with certainty
  * that creates trust, and the partner allows to fall into, knowing the other gotcha (otherwise falling/rolling skills to the rescue)
* people moving in and out; sometimes even out of the stage/dance floor
* it for sure looks less like dance; theater? acrobatics?
  * it's definitely not a jam, more a performance
* it is visible they are able to do "soft rolls"; also manage to do low impact throws
* some parts are clearly done with some dance improvisation background
  * the non-verbal communication part; mirroring; imitating; echoing; amplifying
* there is clearly a "on stage" and an "off stage" (at the side, in the dark; taking a rest? or giving attention?)
* mostly without contact; also without grounding, more light-footed (like kickboxer), dancing/hopping around
* the audience applauds the most for "shiny trickery things"; they would never celebrate the subtleties... the downside of performance: only the outside matters.


Fall After Newton
========================================================================================================================
* duration: 22min
* WHEN? published 1987; a summary from 1972-1983
* WHERE? different places...

* a narrated documentary (by Steve)
  * about: CI, physics and mass in motion
* showing its development after 11 years
* idea was to be able to track the development over the years, how it grew
* work began already 1980, took them 7 years to go through 8 years of videos (about 50 hours of performances)
  * taking parts from other well known videos as well (magnesium, etc.)
  * steve comments on the progress over the years, how CI has changed, their approach (speed, impact, continuation, habitual patterns)
* combination of:
  * contact at 10
  * ReUnion (1975, Natural Dance Studio; Oakland, CA)
  * Magnesium
  * 1980 Judson
  * 1973 "You Come We'll Show You What We Do" (Firehouse Theater SF)
  * 1978 "Contact Quarterly Benefit", Berkely Moving Arts, Berkely CA
* got funding from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Judson Church Dance Project of Bennington College in Vermont.

Content
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* visible how steve is reaching towards, maintain connection and sharing weight
* lots of going in circles while lifting a person
* parts visible from "Contact at 10th and 2nd"
* 1973, already more flow, continuation; 1976 more smoothness (RPoC); more time to feel what was happening
* 1978: they used background music (drumming; but it was an interaction with the musician, mutually impacting each other)
  * they are still not in constant contact as we are, but they very quickly search for contact again once disengaged

Narration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* newton; his laws; lack of subjectivity
* solo work: playing with gravity, looking at it as a partner (not taking it for granted); not directing, but letting it happen; cope with momentum/gravity
* first mentioning (not explicitly though) of a point of contact
* we don't know the movement about to come, but we know the acting forces (gravity, centrifugal forces, weight/support of the partner, ...)
* small dance, a standing meditation; throwing the complementary adrenaline state
* the importance of sensing with (soft) skin; receiving a lot of information; "stretched & adrenalized perception"
* on fear: "The support needed from the unconscious reflexive parts of the brain is more present when the conscious mind is not afraid."
* when falling: extend muscles, instead of contract them; spread impact on greater area; and keep on moving, to spread it even further
* "While in contact, we attend to our own reflexes, which have been stimulated by the other's movements. Our reflexes move us, and this causes our partner to move.
  This cycle of movement responses is continuous and forms the basis of the dialogue."
