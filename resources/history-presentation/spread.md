GLOBAL SPREAD
========================================================================================================================
* nancy said: "The nature of this form is that you need a partner to do it, and I think this is one of the most important reasons it has spread. If you could do it alone, I don’t know how far it would have gone..."
* today it's moving in different directions: dance, theater, education, personal growth, recreation
  * thinking about the "core proposition" of contact. what defines the activity?
  * seems more important now to identify and practice the essential premise of CI as the work continues to expand in new directions
* it started north-east USA, then westcoast and canada; from there to europe (1980s)
* particularly intense presence in:
  * Argentina (biggest in the world; 10 jams per week in Buenos Aires; some with 100+ people)
  * Americas, Western and Eastern Europe, Germany, Finland,
  * Russia, Israel, Japan, Taïwan, Australia, India, China and Malaysia (nothing in Antarctica)
  * as evidenced by the regularity of the jams, festivals and weekly courses taught in these countries

USA
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* jams across major cities in USA
    * multi-day residential spaces (such as the Breitenbush Jam, which has existed since 1981) have been in existence since the late 1970s
    * 1979 Country Jam: 50 people from USA and Canada
        * 12 days, non-structured existence, life and dance (except meals)
        * neither a workshop, a conference or a seminar, but an improvisational gathering
        * system based on Supply and demand
        * hosted at "earthdance"
* Steve toured (with nancy, nita, and others)
  * California tour in January 1973
  * a tour to Rome (at L’Attico gallery) in June 1973
* until the mid-80s, mostly staid in USA/Canada

Europe
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* first time in (June 25-28th) 1973
    * in an art gallery in Rome, L'Attico run by Fabio Sargentini
* Steve Paxton and Lisa Nelson got regularly invited to:
    * Dartington College of Arts, in UK
    * School for New Dance Development, in Amsterdam
        * part of "Academy of Theatre and Dance"
        * https://www.studiegids-dans.ahk.nl/en/2024-2025/study-programmes/sndo-school-for-new-dance-development/
* in France introduced 1978, called "danse-contact"
    * Steve and Lisa Nelson gave course at the musical festivities of Sainte Beaume
    * participants liked it, kept inviting them again, plus Nancy
    * 1980, created "Danse Contact Improvisation" association, teaching themselves
    * today, event taught at "National Conservatory of Music and Dance" of Paris
* Steve invited since 80s in Belgium (by the Klapstuk and the Kaaitheater)
  * not much going on back then, except considerable outbreaks of fever in jams ;) (ecstatic covid anyone?!)
  * not much impact in dance world, except when CI was choreographed
* since 1985, yearly european-wide teachers exchange events

Evolutions, Branches
========================================================================================================================
* much has changed, yet physical contact and improvisation (basic organizing principles), remain unchanged
    * definitely more smooth, less risky/explosive/wild
* different ways and approaches; styles, ideas; more performance art, experimental dance, and education
  * can be: technical, artistic, aesthetical, psychological, sensual/sexual, emotional, therapeutical, energetical
  * nita little: "a purist" - exploring principles; physicality, with a disciplined inquiry mindset; stay curious, do the research (yourself)
    * no interest in people forming ideologies (=ideas of what it is, and then creating rules around it)
    * the reason why it was able to spread so far, is most likely _because_ it is so open (undefined, lack of ideology/dogma; it's freedom, thus can be adapted; no fixed form)
    * therapeutic forms are often trademarked; like feldenkrais and alexander, techniques requiring licensing
    * CI can feel like it's "your baby", but it's a giveaway
* CI influenced: postmodern dance traditions and contemporary performance studies
* steve went on with improvisations, and Goldberg Variations; then material for the spine

Material for the Spine
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* https://www.materialforthespine.com
* 2008; collaboration with Contredanse (Brussels); seeing himself as a movement practitioner
  * about awareness/perception (esp. of the spine)
* an interactive digital publication (DVD-ROM)
  * filmed from below (dancer moves on transparent glass); as if rolling in mid-ar
  * exercises for spiral rolls: helix rolls, crescent roles/banana rolls
* "what the spine is doing in that tumbling sphere with another person—a kind of yogic form, a technique that focuses on the pelvis, the spine, the shoulder blades, the rotation of the head"
* "to bring the light of consciousness to the dark side of the body"
  * indeed, we never saw, and never ever will throughout our lives our own backs (only indirectly through a mirror, or on a picture)

Underscore
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* https://nancystarksmith.com/underscore/
* by Nancy Stark Smith; 1990 (reminds me a bit of 5 rhythms)
* definition: series of exercises leading to long-form CI jams, providing guidance in the development of the dance
  * first "warm up body/mind", then exploration (of connection), then harvest (reflection)
  * using hieroglyph drawings, abstract, subjective notes of internal sensations
    * subjectivities and fluidity in dance as creative practice
* definition/goals:
  * a vehicle for incorporating CI into a broader arena of improvisational dance practice
  * integrating kinesthetic and compositional concerns while improvising
  * helping to develop compositional awareness (sounds more like dance improvisation)
* a long-form dance improvisation structure (lasting usually 3-4 hours)
  * from very small, private, and quiet internal activity; to higher energy and interactive dancing
  * 20+ phases, each with a name and a graphic symbol (glyph)
    * symbols help to provide a language to communicate certain states
    * within a phase (frame), free to create own movements, dynamics, and relationships (with self, others, group, music, environment)
* how's it different than a jam?
  * jam is usually where people come and go, a more social activity
  * underscore is a more "intentional space"
  * or: just a more deliberate/reflective way of doing a jam ;)
* global annual gatherings
  * required to have some CI experience already
  * before participating, need theoretical walkthrough (no verbal instructions during a session)
* see "An Emergent Underscore: a conversation with Nancy Stark Smith, London": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzG609NWp1Y
  * explaining the basics, like betty ford about wheel of consent like
* see "Nancy Stark Smith Teaches "Mini Solo Underscore"- Embodied Activity #2 Meta-academy(at)bates 2013":
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFWRF0WXkAs (rolling around like an insane person in the office)

Tuning Scores
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* from Karen Nelson; influenced by CI, Material for the Spin
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2ks9cotkeA
* mostly done with eyes closed; resembles little (to not at all) CI, more like dance improvisation

Contact Tango
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWRiJavKv_A
* similar with trying to merge zouk with CI: a more trendy/marketing motivation?!
* IMHO: not entirely clear the logic on why/how to combine those two; what they share, how they can enrich each other

Contact Beyond Contact
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* dance and healing practice
* integrating Authentic Movement (AM), Contact Improvisation (CI) and Passing Through (PT)
* https://education.unityspace.org/courses-overview/cbc-ftc/
* promo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pL7YrL5TS0
* IMHO: seems a bit sect like; promising way too much; offering all 512 different systems/religions in one; dangerous, money, promotion, brand (facilitator trainings, certifications, etc.)

Ecstatic Dance dancing "Contact"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* what they think, how they use CI for their hippie events: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTkDj_tkIdg
