GLOBAL SPREAD
========================================================================================================================
* "The nature of this form is that you need a partner to do it, and I think this is one of the most important reasons it has spread. If you could do it alone, I don’t know how far it would have gone..." by Nancy
* today it's moving in different directions: dance, theater, education, personal growth, recreation
  * thinking about the “core proposition” of contact. what defines the activity?
  * seems more important now to identify and practice the essential premise of CI as the work continues to expand in new directions
* jams across major cities in USA
    * multi-day residential spaces (such as the Breitenbush Jam, which has existed since 1981) have been in existence since the late 1970s
    * 1979 Country Jam; 50 people USA and Canada
        * 12 days, non-structured existence, life and dance (except meals)
        * neither a workshop, a conference or a seminar, but an improvisational gathering
        * system based on Supply and demand
        * hosted at "earthdance"
* until the mid-’80s, mostly in USA/Canada
* Steve toured (nancy, nita, ...)
  * California tour in January 1973
  * a tour to Rome (at L’Attico gallery) in June 1973
* particularly intense presence in:
    * Argentina (biggest in the world; 10 jams per week in Buenos Aires; some with 100+ people), Americas, Western and Eastern Europe, Germany, Finland, Russia, Israel, Japan, Taïwan, Australia, India, China and Malaysia (nothing in Antarctica)
    * as evidenced by the regularity of the jams, festivals and weekly courses taught in these countries

Europe
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* first time in 1973 (from June 25-28th)
    * in an art gallery in Rome, L'Attico run by Fabio Sargentini
* Steve and Lisa Nelson regularly invited to:
    * Dartington College of Arts, in UK
    * School for New Dance Development, in Amsterdam
        * part of "Academy of Theatre and Dance"
        * https://www.studiegids-dans.ahk.nl/en/2024-2025/study-programmes/sndo-school-for-new-dance-development/
* since 1985, yearly european-wide teachers exchange events
* Steve invited since 80s in Belgium (by the Klapstuk and the Kaaitheater)
    * not much going on, except considerable outbreaks of fever in jams ;)
    * not much impact in dance world, except when CI was choreographed
* in France introduced 1978, called "danse-contact"
    * Steve and Lisa Nelson gave course at the musical festivities of Sainte Beaume
    * participants liked it, kept inviting them again, plus Nancy
    * 1980, created "Danse Contact Improvisation" association, teaching themselves
    * today, event taught at "National Conservatory of Music and Dance" of Paris

Evolutions, Branches
========================================================================================================================
* much has changed, yet physical contact and improvisation, as well as the basic organizing principles, remain unchanged
    * definitely more smooth, less risky/explosive/wild
* performance art, experimental dance, and education
* different ways and approaches; styles, ideas
  * technical, artistic, aesthetical, psychological, sensual/sexual, emotional, therapeutical, energetical
  * nita little: "a purist" - exploring principles; physicality, with a disciplined inquiry mindset; stay curious, do the research (yourself)
    * no interest in people forming ideologies (=ideas of what it is, and then creating rules around it)
    * the reason why it was able to spread so far, is most likely _because_ it is so open (undefined, lack of ideology/dogma; it's freedom, thus can be adapted; no fixed form)
    * therapeutic forms, trademarked; like feldenkrais and alexander, techniques requiring licensing
    * CI can feel like it's "your baby", but it's a giveaway
* postmodern dance traditions and contemporary performance studies
* steve went on with improvisations, and Goldberg Variations; then material for the spine


Material for the Spine
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* https://www.materialforthespine.com
  * 2008; collaboration with Contredanse (Brussels); seeing himself as a movement practitioner
* about awareness/perception (esp. of the spine)
* an interactive digital publication (DVD-ROM)
* filmed from below (dancer moves on transparent glass); as if rolling in mid-ar
* exercises for spiral rolls: helix rolls, crescent roles/banana rolls
* "what the spine is doing in that tumbling sphere with another person—a kind of yogic form, a technique that focuses on the pelvis, the spine, the shoulder blades, the rotation of the head"
* "to bring the light of consciousness to the dark side of the body"
  * indeed, we never saw, and never ever will throughout our lives our own backs (only indirectly through a mirror, or on a picture)

Tuning Scores

* from Karen Nelson; influenced by CI, Material for the Spin

Contact Beyond Contact
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* dance and healing practice
* https://education.unityspace.org/courses-overview/cbc-ftc/
* promo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pL7YrL5TS0
* integrating Authentic Movement (AM), Contact Improvisation (CI) and Passing Through (PT)
* IMHO: seems a bit sect like; promising way too much; offering all 512 different systems/religions in one; dangerous, money, promotion, brand (facilitator trainings, certifications, etc.)
