BEGINNING
========================================================================================================================
* "birth of CI is as vague as the nature of CI itself"
  * it was characteristic for the first generation of CI-dancers to decide not to define contact improvisation (and not to set up a certification teacher training)
* early participants have divergent stories about the development of the work
    * histories are reduced to narratives of single male heroes, dismissing or minimizing the significant contributions of women and collectives
* 60s great social/political change 
  * cultural ideas shifting/Civil Rights; women/blacks rights; new age movement (eastern religions)
  * post-war, people had enough from violence; mass-protest; now was time for "love peace and harmony"; sex, free love; hippies from california... counter culture.
  * lots of drug taking and rule breaking
  * but still CI (steve paxton) wanted something slightly different.
  * movements like Grand Union and The Judson Church Dance Theatre... challenged expectations, blurring boundaries (audience/performer, art/life)
  * women lifting men was radical in the early 1970s; men being sensitive with each other
  * dance training broadened: included somatic methods (alexander, feldenkrais)
* influenced by:
    * 1950's and '60s popular dance cultures, NY/SF avant garde dance-performance-theatre scenes; modern dance; social dance
    * somatic practices / new body therapies, child's play/child developmental movement, physical comedy
    * eastern influence: martial arts (japanese aikido, and chinese taijiquan); yoga, meditation
    * steve considered it a composite of: wrestling, jitterburg (swing/lindy hop), aikido, gymnastics, modern dance (nothing new invented)
    * social movements for gender and sex liberation
    * playing with physics mainly (friction, momentum, gravity, inertia)
    * too many collisions with Magnesium; Steve tought Aikido rolls/falls/format, moment-to-moment awareness
* dance was/is usually:
  * choreographed (not improvised)
  * synced with music (not async, or even in silence)
  * performance; with an audience (to please, to look aesthetical; like capitalism trying to sell a product, and less like an artistic expression, an internal experience)
* contact improvisation is different than all the other improvisational based approaches
  * CI uses physical approach; others more theatrical, psychological (sourced from movement as gesture as action; not the actual matter of the body)
* they also showed what they were doing in random parks

THE INVENTION EVENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Steve: "they were not trying to overturn an era, but were simply doing the work they felt was appropriate at the time"
* Describe by Nancy/Lisa Nelson: "During a Grand Union residency at Oberlin College in January 1972, Steve Paxton made a work for 11 men in which they threw, caught, flung, collided and fell among one another continuously for 10 minutes. The dance was called 'Magnesium'".
    * Cynthia Novack describes as: "In January 1972 Paxton taught the structure for an improvisational solo he had made for himself to a class of male students at Oberlin College"
* NYC/USA, 1972, Steve received a grant ($2000) from Change, Inc (he applied for one and got accepted)
  * Grand Union was invited to Oberlin College for the monthlong January residency
    * each company member taught a technique-type class in the morning and a performance class in the afternoon
  * under the guidance of steve for a "dance experiment" for 3 weeks (or 1 week???)
  * months after Magnesium => Chute
  * at John Weber Gallery in New York
  * to live and work together over two weeks
* at Oberlin, Steve (age 32) offered two classes to students:
    * 1) "Soft Class" at 7am (cold and dark room)
      * beautiful old wooden men’s gymnasium
      * a chair next to the door; a box of Kleenex; a little plate of cut-up fruit; you took a tissue and a piece of fruit and came into the gym
      * small dance, standing meditation; exploration of postural adjustments/micro-weight transfers
      * also: yogic breathing exercises
      * being on the edge of falling asleep and waking
      * "then you’d blow your nose and eat the fruit, and after an hour, the sun came up and that was the end of the class"
    * 2) extremes of movement, dis/orientation for (young, 20-30) men only
      * falling, rolling, colliding, jumping in the air (influenced by modern dance and aikido), and also small dance; on mats
    * after 3 weeks/end of the month: combination of both led to a 20min performance: "Magnesium" (the seminal dance for CI)
        * jumping, bumping, manipulating, clinging; on gym mats; extremes of dis-/orientation
        * he decided to only work with men (11 of them)
            * nancy stark smith watched (back then 19 years), and asked him to also join (as a woman); only a few months later in NY she was invited to join
            * reason unclear... strength? more rough/tumble/wild? women too soft/fragile/afraid? parts of women not allowed to be touched is limiting?
              * according to interview with him, because he wanted to explore a more rough form, and couldn't have done that with women (he needed athletes)
        * began by standing still and then started to fall off balance—falling through the space, spilling onto the mat, rolling, getting up, with little soft collisions, slides, falls —staggering around the space like they were drunk
        * after 15mins dancing wild, ended with 5mins of small dance
    * he used language of physics to describe CI movements (momentum, gravity, chaos, inertia); due to gap in dance training
    * he also wanted to investigate the absence of partnering (in modern dance/ballet)
* after magnesium:
  * continued to develop his ideas from it
  * teaching at Bennington College, got a small travel grant 
    * brought a group together in NYC in June
  * he invited colleagues (group of dancers and athletes) to evolve his form:
      * 12-15 students and colleagues he'd met while teaching at Oberlin, Bennington, and Rochester
      * Oberlin college students: Nancy Stark Smith and Curt Siddall
      * Judson Dance Theater (Barbara Dilley and Nancy Topf)
      * University of Rochester (Mary Fulkerson teaching): Danny Lepkoff and David Woodberry
      * Mary Fulkerson (release technique pioneer)
      * Bennington College: Nita Little, Laura Chapman, ...
      * Laura Chapman
      * ... colleagues in NYC
* the NY/Manhatten performances first called "Contact Improvisation"
    * performed 5 hours a day
    * few months after Magnesium; nancy was invited (as a woman)
* improvised encounter between two people
    * usual choreographic process as a dictatorship of teachers and choreographers creating watered-down versions of themselves
    * less authoritarian form of leadership based on suggestion, invitation, improvisation, and collaboration
* performances, lasting five hours daily, were presented more as a visual art event/happening/installation rather than as a dance concert
* result of this workgroup (after one week), a performance called "Contact Improvisations"
    * (at New York's Soho art gallery)
    * performance at the John Weber Gallery
    * Steve said: "We worked at the Weber and showed our progress - and lack of it - to the public because I had a strong feeling this was something that should be seen from the beginning, that it was going to progress."
    * Steve made a postcard announcement—on the front was a picture of the Coney Island parachute jump, a ride at the amusement park.
    * Steve went to Chinatown and had fortune cookies made with a fortune that said something like, “Come to John Weber Gallery—contact improvisations,” and we gave them to everybody in the street.
    * continuous afternoon (5 hours) performance (on mats) over five days, every day
        * people could come and go, while dancers continued
    * film was playing in background: "Cry Dr. Chicago" from George Manupelli
        * https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203426/
        * watch excerpt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynOCt-aCe30
        * unconventional and absurdly provocative
        * about a strangely sympathetic medical imposter in pursuit of his impossible dream
* this was first time the dance was referred to as "Contact Improvisation"
* after that, members spread across the USA

FIRST STEPS AFTER INVENTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* was considered too avant-garde for most dancers
    * today CI is offered in many institutions (for training the body and tool for generating choreography)
    * fun/playfulness reputation: just a "feel good" social dance form; more fun to do than to watch
* initially syncopated, risky, raw and awkward style; quickly more aesthetic:
    * smooth, continuous, controlled flow (late 70s, begin 80s)

* after John Weber shows: Nita Little, Curt Siddall and Nancy Stark Smith, moved to the Bay Area; important performance scene
    * february 1973 first time CI seen in Bay Area
    * Paxton and the Oberlin/Weber dancers who were touring the West Coast
    * show/tour "called You Come We'll Show You What We Do", 1973
      * steve, nancy and nita; "first CI tour" on west coast (up and down)
    * The West Coast Contact Improvisation Festival (WCCIF) in the 90's became an annual gathering for the local community as well as a model for CI events around the world
* touring 1975 under name of "ReUnion"
* 1975 considered trademarking
    * basically CI could have existed only for 2 weeks (1 week rehearsal, 1 week performance)
        * because most of the dancers moved on to their next idea
        * but gladly it survived and grew ever since, partly thanks to not trademarking it (no exclusive claim on CI)
        * Steve didn't want to control, but see how it evolves by itself
            * he considered though copyrighting/trademarking it, due to the number of injuries happening
              * bruises were normal, but some people had pretty serious injuries
              * for them, the soft (small dance, subtle sensing work) balanced the bigger (dangerous), thus it was safer
              * BUT: "people who just saw a performance would try the bigger, flashier moves without the other training" by nancy
            * people imitated moves (throwing, catching) without learning the fundamentals (sensitivity, touch, gravity)
            * preventing CI being used recklessly...
            * but decided against it, instead went for an "ongoing dialog"
            * no elite commanding CI; no Paxton Institute (years and a fortune), no teacher accreditation
    * control teaching, education, practice; safety (and money? maintaining tradition, purity)
    * they wrote up the papers and almost signed, but decided not to
      * didn't want to become the "contact cops"; policing if they do it, and not certified, need to tell them to stop, not allowed
      * BUT: they will do it anyway but just not call it contact improvisation (primal/ritual/impulse play)
      * coherence and connectedness would have been lost
    * instead a forum for communication created: "Contact Newsletter" (its former name, later renamed to "Contact Quarterly")
        * founded by Nancy; co-edited by Lisa Nelson
        * based on fundamental ideals of equality, non-hierarchy, and individual freedom (like CI itself)
        * to encourage this open dialog, without the need of an authority commanding CI
        * they started this way before the internet!
        * evolved into the bi-annual journal "Contact Quarterly"
        * still published online by the non-profit Contact Collaborations (incorporated in 1978)
        * final print edition came out in January 2020
        * nancy said: "Once you get a clear feel for the basic premise, develop a few safety skills, and get your reflexes primed and ready, then you're off. You learn by doing"
    * there are some significant downsides with having no certification; but still the pros outweight the cons
      * now it's like this whisper game: it goes around, everyone interpreting it themselves; when it would come back to steve, he would not (barely) recognize it
* 1975 "ReUnion" group formed
* 70s/80s many contact companies formed: Mangrove, Contactworks, Catpoto, Fulcrum, Freelance, ... (San Francisco, Minneapolis, Montreal, Vancouver, and New York)
* ad jams: a new thing - there are no modern dance jams or ballet jams
    * in contemporary dance world: you have class, rehearsal, and performance
    * possible explanation: Coming from Steve’s experience with the martial arts: dojo mentality of people at different levels training together
    * the way to keep practicing
    * Nancy: "The Breitenbush Jam in Oregon was one of the first retreat jams, at a beautiful, remote hot springs. After a few years, there wasn’t enough room for everybody that wanted to come, so another jam started at the Harbin Hot Springs in California. And then the East Coast people didn’t want to have to travel so far, so they made an East Coast Jam. And then festivals started and facilities (like Arlequi in Spain and Earthdance in Massachusetts) began to offer regular CI workshops and events."
* mixed-ability dance work started in the early- to mid-1980s; range of physical and mental disabilities
  * e.g., british government grants to spread CI, in prisons, hospitals, ...
  * non-young-white-male professionals; some people not being able to do simple forward rolls
* there was no music at the beginning. full stop.
  * "The body’s communication with gravity and the other physical forces has its own timing", nancy, "Our habit as dancers is to take our timing from the music, so it took some practice to get our timing organized with each other and these forces before we could add the partner of music. What Steve says on the videotape Fall After Newton is that we started to use music to break up the movement habits we had established dancing without music."
* sexuality?
  * "There were often love affairs on the side because we were opening to each other in deep ways. Partly because of the 1960s and the free-love sexual revolution flower/hippie thing, Steve wanted to make a clear distinction that this was not that. He needed to make a stronger edge." by Nancy
