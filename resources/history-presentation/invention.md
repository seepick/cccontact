* "birth of CI is as vague as the nature of CI itself"
  * it was characteristic for the first generation of CI-dancers to decide not to define contact improvisation
* early participants have divergent stories about the development of the work
    * histories might be reduced to narratives of single male heroes, dismissing or minimizing the significant contributions of women and collectives

ENVIRONMENT
========================================================================================================================
* 60s great social/political change
  * cultural ideas shifting:
    * civil rights; women/blacks rights; new age movement (eastern religions)
    * post-war, people had enough from violence; mass-protest; now was time for "love peace and harmony"; sex, free love; hippies from california... the counter culture
    * "lots of drug taking and rule breaking"
    * but still CI (steve paxton) wanted something slightly different...
  * movements like Grand Union and The Judson Church Dance Theatre...
    * challenged expectations, blurring boundaries (audience/performer, art/life)
    * women lifting men was radical in the early 1970s; men being sensitive with each other
    * dance training broadened: included somatic methods (alexander, feldenkrais)
* influenced by:
  * 1950s/60s popular dance cultures, NY/SF avant garde dance-performance-theatre scenes; modern dance; social dance; sports
  * somatic practices / new body therapies, child's play/child developmental movement, physical comedy
  * eastern influence: martial arts (japanese aikido, and chinese taijiquan); yoga, meditation
  * steve considered it a composite of (nothing new invented): wrestling, jitterburg (swing/lindy hop), aikido, gymnastics, modern dance
  * social movements for gender and sex liberation
  * playing with physics mainly (friction, momentum, gravity, inertia)
* dance was/is usually:
  * choreographed (not improvised)
  * synced with music (not async, or even in silence)
  * performance; with an audience (to please, to look aesthetical; like capitalism trying to sell a product, and less like an artistic expression, an internal experience)
  * CI is different (physical approach) than all the other improvisational based approaches (theatrical, psychological)


INVENTION
========================================================================================================================
* Steve: "they were not trying to overturn an era, but were simply doing the work they felt was appropriate at the time"
  * CI was deeply rooted in Paxton’s former work, and did not emerge out of a vacuum
  * walking, sitting, standing; weight, rolling, falling; improvisation, non-hierarchy, democractic
  * BUT: he didn't _invent_ CI; he says: "It's governed by the participants rather than by a leader, similar to the structure of Grand Union."
  * CI "originates" from him, he initiated it. BUT: he didn't "invent" it, as it took many different people (with many different background) to set the foundation. them, collaborating, researching and setting the path, was done in gatherings organized by steve as well.
* basically the region where it happened was all north east of USA (new york, vermont, massachusetts, ohio); later also westcoast (california)
  * they also showed what they were doing in random parks ;) park jams yay

PRE-MAGNESIUM
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Cynthia Novack: "In January 1972 Paxton taught the structure for an improvisational solo he had made for himself to a class of male students at Oberlin College"
  * Nancy/Lisa Nelson: "During a Grand Union residency at Oberlin College in January 1972, Steve Paxton made a work for 11 men in which they threw, caught, flung, collided and fell among one another continuously for 10 minutes. The dance was called 'Magnesium'".
* NYC/USA, 1972, Steve applied and received a grant ($2000) from "Change, Inc"
  * Grand Union was invited to Oberlin College for the monthlong January residency
    * each company member taught a technique-type class in the morning and a performance class in the afternoon
  * to live and work together under the guidance of steve for a "dance experiment" for 3 weeks
  * (at John Weber Gallery in New York ???)
* at Oberlin, Steve (age 32) offered two classes to students:
  * first: "Soft Class"
    * at 7am (in a cold and dark room)
      * beautiful old wooden men’s gymnasium
      * a chair next to the door; a box of Kleenex; a little plate of cut-up fruit; you took a tissue and a piece of fruit and came into the gym
    * small dance, standing meditation; exploration of postural adjustments/micro-weight transfers
      * also: yogic breathing exercises
      * being on the edge of falling asleep and waking
    * "then you’d blow your nose and eat the fruit, and after an hour, the sun came up and that was the end of the class"
  * second: afternoon class; for (young, 20-30) men only
    * on mats: extremes of movement, dis/orientation (disorientation is like blinking: awareness gone for a moment)
      * the reflexes shut down consciousness for a moment, so automatism can take over (help survive)
    * taught students what he learned in his solo, experience of aikido (safe landing)
    * influenced by modern dance and aikido
      * falling/rolling (together)
      * colliding, (collapsing into collision,  "soft" collision)
      * jumping in the air
    * also small dance
  * after 3 weeks/end of the month: combination of both classes led to a 20min performance: "Magnesium" (the seminal dance for CI)

MAGNESIUM
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* worked on a solo / came out of aikido dreams
  * dreamed about being in space, no gravity, any crazy position, landing without any damage
  * practiced on grass, lawn, mats, water
  * by getting one limb underneath you, keeping the roll going
  * not just falling straight/perpendicular, but bend the shape, working in the dimension
* began by standing still and then started to fall off balance
  * jumping, bumping, manipulating, clinging; crashing on gym mats; extremes of dis-/orientation
  * falling through the space, spilling onto the mat, rolling, getting up, with little soft collisions, slides, falls
    * staggering around the space like they were drunk
  * after 15mins dancing wild, ended with 5mins of small dance (after chaos, order/quiet)
* he decided to only work with men (11 of them)
  * nancy stark smith watched (back then 19 years), and asked him to also join (as a woman)
    * only a few months later in NY she was invited to join
    * according to interview with him, because he wanted to explore a more rough form, and couldn't have done that with women (he needed athletes)
* he used language of physics to describe CI movements (momentum, gravity, chaos, inertia); due to gap in dance training
  * he also wanted to investigate the absence of partnering (in modern dance/ballet)
* there was a high chance, that this was it: just another performance of steve; nothing more
  * BUT: in the summer of 1972 Steve created a group to experiment with and develop further what he had begun


CHUTE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Steve continued to develop his ideas from magnesium
  * too many collisions with Magnesium: Steve taught Aikido rolls/falls/format, moment-to-moment awareness
* teaching at Bennington College, he got a small travel grant 
  * brought a group together in Manhatten/NYC in June, a few months after magnesium (result => Chute)
* he invited colleagues (group of dancers and athletes; male and female) to evolve his form:
    * 12-15 students and colleagues he'd met while teaching at Oberlin, Bennington, and Rochester
    * Nancy Stark Smith and Curt Siddall (Oberlin college)
    * Barbara Dilley and Nancy Topf (Judson Dance Theater)
    * Nita Little, Laura Chapman, etc. (Bennington College)
    * Danny Lepkoff and David Woodberry (University of Rochester)
    * Mary Fulkerson (release technique pioneer; teacher at Rochester)
    * and some more colleagues from NYC
* result of this workgroup (after one week):
  * a performance called "Contact Improvisations" on mats, at the John Weber Gallery / Soho art gallery
  * this was the first time the dance was referred to as "Contact Improvisation"
  * lasting 5 hours each day (afternoon), for 5 days, every day
    * this all was videotaped; together they then watched those 5 hours; comment on what they saw
  * presented more as a visual art event/happening/installation rather than as a dance concert
    * people could come and go, while dancers continued
  * improvised encounter between two people
    * usual choreographic process as a dictatorship of teachers and choreographers creating watered-down versions of themselves
    * less authoritarian form of leadership based on suggestion, invitation, improvisation, and collaboration
  * film was playing in background: "Cry Dr. Chicago" from George Manupelli (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203426/)
      * unconventional and absurdly provocative; about a strangely sympathetic medical imposter in pursuit of his impossible dream
      * watch excerpt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynOCt-aCe30
  * advertisment/marketing:
    * Steve made a postcard announcement—on the front was a picture of the Coney Island parachute jump, a ride at the amusement park.
    * Steve went to Chinatown and had fortune cookies made with a fortune that said something like, “Come to John Weber Gallery—contact improvisations,” and we gave them to everybody in the street.
  * Steve said: "We worked at the Weber and showed our progress - and lack of it - to the public because I had a strong feeling this was something that should be seen from the beginning, that it was going to progress."
* after that, members spread across the USA...

POST-CHUTE
========================================================================================================================

80s happenings
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* West Coast
  * after John Weber shows: Nita Little, Curt Siddall and Nancy Stark Smith, moved to the Bay Area; important performance scene
  * february 1973 first time CI seen in Bay Area
  * Paxton and the Oberlin/Weber dancers who were touring the West Coast
  * show/tour "called You Come We'll Show You What We Do", 1973
    * steve, nancy and nita; "first CI tour" on west coast (up and down)
  * The West Coast Contact Improvisation Festival (WCCIF) in the 90's became an annual gathering for the local community as well as a model for CI events around the world
* touring 1975 under name of "ReUnion"
* 70s/80s many contact companies formed: Mangrove, Contactworks, Catpoto, Fulcrum, Freelance, ... (San Francisco, Minneapolis, Montreal, Vancouver, and New York)
* mixed-ability dance work started in the early- to mid-1980s; range of physical and mental disabilities
  * e.g., british government grants to spread CI, in prisons, hospitals, ...
  * non-young-white-male professionals; some people not being able to do simple forward rolls
* ad jams: a new thing - there are no modern dance jams or ballet jams
  * in contemporary dance world: you have class, rehearsal, and performance
  * possible explanation: Coming from Steve’s experience with the martial arts: dojo mentality of people at different levels training together
  * the way to keep practicing
  * Nancy: "The Breitenbush Jam in Oregon was one of the first retreat jams, at a beautiful, remote hot springs. After a few years, there wasn’t enough room for everybody that wanted to come, so another jam started at the Harbin Hot Springs in California. And then the East Coast people didn’t want to have to travel so far, so they made an East Coast Jam. And then festivals started and facilities (like Arlequi in Spain and Earthdance in Massachusetts) began to offer regular CI workshops and events."

Trademark
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 1975 considered trademarking
* basically CI could have existed only for 2 weeks (1 week rehearsal, 1 week performance)
    * because most of the dancers moved on to their next idea
    * but gladly it survived and grew ever since, partly thanks to not trademarking it (no exclusive claim on CI)
    * Steve didn't want to control, but see how it evolves by itself
        * he considered though copyrighting/trademarking it, due to the number of injuries happening
          * bruises were normal, but some people had pretty serious injuries
          * for them, the soft (small dance, subtle sensing work) balanced the bigger (dangerous), thus it was safer
          * BUT: "people who just saw a performance would try the bigger, flashier moves without the other training" by nancy
        * people imitated moves (throwing, catching) without learning the fundamentals (sensitivity, touch, gravity)
        * preventing CI being used recklessly...
        * but decided against it, instead went for an "ongoing dialog"
        * no elite commanding CI; no Paxton Institute (years and a fortune), no teacher accreditation
* control teaching, education, practice; safety (and money? maintaining tradition, purity)
* they wrote up the papers and almost signed, but decided not to
  * didn't want to become the "contact cops"; policing if they do it, and not certified, need to tell them to stop, not allowed
     * to set up a (expensive) certification teacher training (like with so many other things)
  * BUT: they will do it anyway but just not call it contact improvisation (primal/ritual/impulse play)
  * coherence and connectedness would have been lost
* instead a forum for communication created: Contact Quarterly
* there are some significant downsides with having no certification; but still the pros outweight the cons
  * now it's like this whisper game: it goes around, everyone interpreting it themselves; when it would come back to steve, he would not (barely) recognize it

Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* there was no MUSIC at the beginning. full stop.
  * Nancy says: "The body’s communication with gravity and the other physical forces has its own timing. Our habit as dancers is to take our timing from the music, so it took some practice to get our timing organized with each other and these forces, before we could add the partner of music. What Steve says on the videotape 'Fall After Newton' is, that we started to use music to break up the movement habits, we had established dancing without music."
* SEXUALITY?!
  * Nancy says: "There were often love affairs on the side because we were opening to each other in deep ways. Partly because of the 1960s and the free-love sexual revolution flower/hippie thing, Steve wanted to make a clear distinction that this was not that. He needed to make a stronger edge."

Today
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* CI was considered too avant-garde for most dancers
  * today CI is offered in many institutions (for training the body and tool for generating choreography)
  * fun/playfulness reputation: just a "feel good" social dance form; more fun to do than to watch
* initially syncopated, risky, raw and awkward style; quickly more aesthetic:
  * smooth, continuous, controlled flow (late 70s, begin 80s)
* steve basically created CI; under his supervision, invited a couple of people
  * stopped completely with CI in 80s, didn't like what it had became: "this exit, my major artistic achievement"
