MOTIVATION
========================================================================================================================
* know myself, know the others; know where your place is; what's "inside" and what's "outside"
  * i am i, because you are you; the self defines itself through the others
* by understanding the past, we understand the present (and can more anticipate the future)
  * true for individual level (psychological) and larger scale (history, sociology)
  * the past once was the present, thus going into the past-past, ad infinitum
  * like gravity: although decreasing in force exponentially, it never totally ceases to exert force
    * like people are interconnected in eternity, everyone, forever
    * like Indra's net of buddhism: an infinitely largely net, with infinite amount of jewels, each reflecting each other infinitely (interconnectedness/perfect interfusion)
* know and remember the history, our roots (the community behind it)
* pay our respect to the ones who created it, giving it to us, enabling us to do it (the people behind)
* "The values of that period were somehow built into the practice. It’s like geology and the formation of rocks—when something forms, it takes into its structure the forces that are in the environment at the time", Nancy
