Steve (Steven Douglas) Paxton
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Facts
    * Born: 21.1.1939 in Phoenix/Arizona (later Connecticut and NYC)
      * grew up in Tucson/Arizona
      * lived since 1970 at "Mad Brook Farm" in Vermont (Orleans, far North-East of USA); country life, gardening
        * moved there with Lisa Nelson; country life and gardening + international teacher
      * Died: 20.2.2024 (age 85) at his farm
    * father Douglas Paxton; head of security (campus policeman) for university in Tucson/Arizona
    * mother catherine (hamilton) paxton; bookkeeper, english tutor
    * brother David, sister Sherry
    * longterm relationship with/life companion Lisa Nelson (lived at farm with her and other dance partners
    * ??? daughter Sara Paxton (together with Lucia)
* CI was deeply rooted in Paxton’s former work, and did not emerge out of a vacuum
  * walking, sitting, standing; weight, rolling, falling; improvisation, non-hierarchy, democractic
  * BUT: he didn't _invent_ CI; he says: "It's governed by the participants rather than by a leader, similar to the structure of Grand Union."
  * CI "originates" from him, he initiated it. BUT: he didn't "invent" it, as it took many different people (with many different background) to set the foundation. them, collaborating, researching and setting the path, was done in gatherings organized by steve as well.
* athlete, a gymnast, a martial artist, and a modern dancer (choreographer)
* profession:
    * gymnastics as a child (excelled in it)
        * later said: "startling to explore the acrobatic flow between two people who are improvising together"
    * dance when in high school
    * ultimately: experimental/avant-garde dancer, choreographer
    * dropped out shortly after University of Arizona to become a professional dancer
      * he didn't like the teachers
    * scholarship at American Dance Festival at Connecticut College the summer of 1958
      * studied with José Limón and encountered Merce Cunningham’s work
      * he said: "I regarded myself as a barbarian entering the hallowed halls of culture when I came to New York"
    * later moved to NY in 1960s to study classical modern dance
      * first 1 year at José Limón's company
      * later 3 years with Merce Cunningham (more post-modern)
      * but more known for Western contemporary dance
    * dancer in Merce Cunningham Dance Company from 1961-64
      * thus referred to as a "Cunningham Dancer"
      * a break-up with fine-arts, with his way of expressing himself
      * getting rid of (Cunningham) technique, only express through shapes
    * martial arts (aikido; taijiquan)
      * // i personally have many many years experience in both, thus i'm a bit sceptical about his depth in those
      * unclear how many years/how intense his training was, how deep his understanding/knowledge; he said "he had done a lot of"; it was a profound shift for him; no training in fighting
      * the way aikidokas do their roll has saved him from injury many times; projecting into the fall (extend limbs, rather bend)
      * dance different: supporting each centers, opposed to martial arts, destabilizing it
      * he was in Japan (how often? how long? practiced aikido there?)
      * back then, eastern traditions/martial arts not yet available/popular in the west (as it is today)
      * what he learned though is, that there is no need for "winning/losing" or an "opponent"; instead, respond to violence with harmony; our society is soaked with that win/lose mentality (economics, sports, even love and sex) 
    * founding member of "Judson Dance Theater" (1962) and "Grand Union" (1970)
      * two movements that marked the outbreak of Postmodern dance
    * also dancer in "Merce Cunningham Dance Company" from 1961-64
    * next to being a leading figure for CI, it is said he was the same also for the Judson Dance Theater, and the Grand Union. 
* A Buddha of American Dance, A Grand Old Man of Post-Modern Dance or the inventor of walking.
  * yet he talks of himself as an angry person; "cultivating his pessmism"
* "Most of them modern dance choreographers were quite dramatically emotional, or (had) a romantic style... except for Merce Cunningham, who really developed the most important abstract style, and that was what I was drawn to. He wasn’t dealing with the emotions. He was looking more at a kind of physics of dance, and to get to that point in the most pristine way possible, the work couldn’t be dramatized." Paxton 1997/1989
  * away from conventional dance training and aesthetics, and towards pedestrian movements and martial arts
* awards:
    * 1980, National Endowment for the Arts.
    * 1987, New York Dance and Performance Bessie Award
    * 1994 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award

    * 2015 yet another Bessie Award, this time for lifetime achievement
* he basically created CI; under his supervision, invited couple of people
    * also: central figure in the development of postmodern dance (basically based on Cunningham)
        * non-emotional, abstract and analytic; non-hierarchical (opposed to modern dance)
        * modern dance (Graham, Limón, Cunningham, Humphrey, Dunham) gave permission to create new forms “from the ground up.”
    * stopped completely with CI in 80s, didn't like what it had became: "this exit, my major artistic achievement"
* personality/character:
  * he wasn’t a warm and fuzzy teacher, he was thrillingly articulate; he never faked enthusiasm
  * discrete and radical, even provocative
  * an unwilling leader:
    * refuse taking the chair at a talk, show up late or not at all (even to his own performances)
    * at a workshop of his: only gave a simple physical task and then walked away again, leaving participants alone for the rest of the time
    * also: a mild, seemingly humble appearance; thus not rude, snobbish, or arrogant
    * ultimately: his unwillingness to take a central position, has put him even more firmly in exactly that position
  * fascinated by human body: described it as a physical machine that can be expressive by nature and the culture around it
    * also with simple things: sitting, standing, walking; pedestrians especially
    * once was assigned a performance for 1 minute. what he did: sitting on a bench and eating a sandwich
* all of his works/performances were improvised
* early works:
    * 1961: "Proxy" - first dance ever; explored simple things, like: walking, sitting, and eating (a pear), drinking glass of water; poses from sports photographs
    * 1964: Jag Vill Gärna Telefonera - interest in shape/texture/size, even animals changed his vocabulary
        * three chickens, a full-sized overstuffed chair made of cake and yellow frosting, and clothes with zippers
    * 1966: Physical Things
    * 1967: "Satisfyin' Lover" - fascination with pedestrian world, the ordinary; dozens of people; walking, standing (still), or sitting; most known work with 40 people (no skill required)!

    * 1970: Intravenous Lecture
    * 1978: PA RT (with Lisa Nelson, on a music by Robert Ashley)
    * 1986: Goldberg Variations
      * structured improvisational dance performance; only one rule: "to do it differently every time"
      * amazing to watch, esp. with bach's music; piano played by Glenn Gould

    * father a doctor, and she almost became one herself too (but more drawn to moving and writing)
* education
    * as child/youth, trained as athlete/gymnast
      * dance not interesting to her: "I’d see the dancers standing in front of a wall of mirrors looking at themselves and making little movements. I didn’t understand what was exciting about that."
    * BUT: at Oberlin College (along Curt Siddall), intrigued by movement practices => inspired studying modern/post-modern dance
        * finished studies of dance and writing; although first thought dancing was "too narcissistic" (thus initially more into sports and gymnastics)
        * she was trained in sports, but started to dislike it more because of its competitiveness
    * in college, took a class with Steve; wanted to join, but Steve worked only with male dancers
    * in 1972, she was allowed to participate though, showed performances at John Weber Gallery
    * in 1975 she graduated; living north California
* steve said about her: "She was athletic, she was responsive, she would take initiative… she was very daring"
    * he was more of a teacher to her (age difference of 13 years; he was teaching at Oberlin where she joined as a freshman)
* founder/board of director of Contact Collaborations; main person driving Contact Quarterly
* 1990 developed "Underscore"
    * series of exercises leading to long-form contact improvisation jams, providing guidance in the development of the dance
    * first "warm up body/mind", then exploration (of connection), then harvest (reflection)
    * using hieroglyph drawings, abstract, subjective notes of internal sensations (subjectivities and fluidity in dance as creative practice); more about aesthetics
* she got really some fantastic bad ass skills; esp. falling/rolling down softly, gently, controlled; she always got herself (in the recordings at least)

  * said about steve: "Steve’s was the most severe and rigorous of all the work that appeared in and around Judson during the 1960s. Eschewing music, spectacle, and his own innate kinetic gifts and acquired virtuosity, he embraced extended duration and so-called pedestrian movement while maintaining a seemingly obdurate disregard for audience expectation."
