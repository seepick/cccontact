Hard Facts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * He never faked enthusiasm.
  * He was discrete and radical, even provocative.
  * He was brilliant and very intelligent.
  * He was mild, with a seemingly humble appearance. Never perceived as rude, snobbish, or arrogant.
  * an unwilling leader:
      * refuse taking the chair at a talk, show up late or not at all (even to his own performances)
      * at a workshop of his: only gave a simple physical task and then walked away again, leaving participants alone for the rest of the time
      * ultimately: his unwillingness to take a central position (for CI), has put him even more firmly in exactly that position

Profession
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* gymnastics as a child (excelled in it)
    * later said: "startling to explore the acrobatic flow between two people who are improvising together"
* he started to dance when he was in high school
* dropped out shortly after University of Arizona to become a professional dancer ("he didn't like the teachers")
* scholarship at American Dance Festival at Connecticut College the summer of 1958
  * he said: "I regarded myself as a barbarian entering the hallowed halls of culture when I came to New York"

Dance
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* teaching at Oberlin College (invention place of CI) and Bennington College (met Lisa Nelson there)
* later moved to NY in 1960s to study classical modern dance with José Limón and Merce Cunningham
* 1960s in NY:
    * first 1 year at José Limón's company
    * later 3 years with Merce Cunningham (more post-modern)
    * but he was more known for Western contemporary dance
* dancer in Merce Cunningham Dance Company from 1961-64
    * thus referred to as a "Cunningham Dancer"
    * a break-up with fine-arts, with his way of expressing himself
    * getting rid of (Cunningham) technique, only express through shapes
* "Most of them modern dance choreographers were quite dramatically emotional, or (had) a romantic style... except for Merce Cunningham, who really developed the most important abstract style, and that was what I was drawn to. He wasn’t dealing with the emotions. He was looking more at a kind of physics of dance, and to get to that point in the most pristine way possible, the work couldn't be dramatized." Paxton 1990s
    * away from conventional dance training and aesthetics, and towards pedestrian movements and martial arts
* central figure in the development of postmodern dance (basically based on Cunningham)
  * non-emotional, abstract and analytic; non-hierarchical (opposed to modern dance)
  * modern dance (Graham, Limón, Cunningham, Humphrey, Dunham) gave permission to create new forms "from the ground up"
  * changed and challenged the aspects of traditional modern dance
* founding member of "Judson Dance Theater" (1962) and "Grand Union" (1970)
  * two movements that marked the outbreak of Postmodern dance
  * next to being a leading figure for CI, it is said he was the same also for those two groups

Martial Arts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* japanese aikido; (also -a bit?-taijiquan)
* he said "he had done a lot of" (he was in Japan) // unclear intense his training was; how deep his understanding/knowledge
* back then, eastern traditions/martial arts not yet available/popular in the west (as it is today)
* it was a profound shift for him; he had no training in fighting
  * dance is different: supporting each centers, opposed to martial arts, destabilizing it
* what he learned though is, that:
  * the way aikidokas do their roll has saved him from injury many times; projecting into the fall (extend limbs, rather bend)
  * there is no need for "winning/losing" or an "opponent"
    * instead, respond to violence with harmony
    * our society is soaked with that win/lose mentality (economics, sports, even love and sex)

      * she was trained in sports, but started to dislike it more because of its competitiveness
    * studied at Oberlin College (along Curt Siddall), intrigued by movement practices
      * she got inspired to study modern/post-modern dance
