1) what is CI for me?
====================================================
- difficult to capture (by design); like a fish: the harder you try to grab it, the more it will slide out of your hand (like the name of god/dao)
- a principle based movement system (not techniques focused)
- with other terms: dance, acrobatics, sport, martial art (aspects, without the intention though), playing, research, non-verbal communication (interaction)
- moving together (alone not possible, not really)
- improvised, in the moment, without a plan, only realizing potential
- egalitarian, flat, open, liberal, modern
- very touchy, cosy, intimate (food for the soul); on physical and mental level
- personal development: working on trust (issues), fear, excitement; regulating (through breath), relaxing in difficult/stressful/dangerous situations

2) movement: grounding/pushing/pulling/yielding/extending/reaching?
====================================================
- grounding means being stable yet relaxed, a firm foundation which can carry a lot of weight
- pushing is active and deliberate, engaged and tense (chinese: lu, instead of jing), moving the other/oneself away from something, directed/focused
- pulling opposite of pushing
- yielding means to let go, to surrender into a force (push/pull, gravity/person), to adapt/flexibility, a bit of giving up (in a positive, stable, "grounded" way)
- extending is expanding into the space around, taking up space, making oneself big and visible (chinese: peng, inflating)
- reaching is more focused, with eyes and fingers (for example) to go towards something (pointy/directed) which is further away and needs to be moved to, to reach it

3) principles: what is sharing weight/rolling point of contact/pathway continuation?
====================================================
- sharing weight requires grounding, different from push and lean, staying in my own center yet connect it to the other person's center; a redirection of force
- rolling point, like a movie/song recording in a single take, like a line drawing without lifting the pen; it  maintains the connection (over which communication/information exchange happens)
- pathway continuation allows predictability, creating trust between partners, and also works in alignment with natural laws (physics, momentum) to move efficiently

4) what makes a good CI practitioner good?
====================================================
- attitude, not skill - patience, softness/gentleness, listening, not lifts
- curious about the person and what's happening, asking questions and listening, engaging actively in a conversation (not a monologue) and be aware/present; adapts/adjusts to the partner, negotiating together and with the moment (not forcing, but letting it happen)
- with a new partner: starting slow, takes time for "ass sniffing" (negative space first), and then investigates where to go, how much to go, what is possible/not
- found the sweetspot of soft yet strong; not collapsing (overly soft) and not tensed (overly strong)
- dancing with the dance and what is, the potential/possibilities, not with the partner (no sensuality, personal attachment)
- an active research attitude, some seriousness, depth, effort to explore; presence, investment, dedication (not only chaotic, wild, hedonistic fun, going crazy and dangerously risky)
- more focused on the principles (basics, basics, basics) then techniques

5) what are my needs, what my allergies during a dance?
====================================================
- i need slow, i need careful; only after trust established, we can go crazy (faster, higher, crazy/dangerous)
- i need technique and skill need to be leveled; with skilled people i can go crazy (with others not); i dislike it when people over-estimate their skill (too eager or simply dunning kruger effect?!)
- i need people to be calm, peaceful; are they able to listen to me, or am i being ignored?!
- i need to feel groundedness; if a person doesn't have balance, and just engages in sensual butterfly touch, it's nice, but something different, and not what i like when i expect a CI dance; hearing little elephants make me feel disengaging the dance (unsafe)
- i have a big need for safety, for trust: A) slow, sensitive, and B) listening, collaboration, mutual, together...
