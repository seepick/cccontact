CHECKLIST
====================================================================================================
FINALIZATION
--------------------------------------------------
* glossary: scan whole document for (fancy) terms, whether added
* machine proof-reading: intellij, language tool
* human proof-reading: let content be checked (by CI practitioners)
  * provide them a template of what i expect (see /resources/feedback/_feedback_form.txt)

RELEASE
--------------------------------------------------
* generate inner content: ./bin/build.sh (makes proper glossary)
* PRINT (Lulu)
  * select existing project: overwrite content & cover PDF
  * check no overlong lines (can be done in lulu preview)
  * adjust cover if needed (page count changing; spine width changes)
* ONLINE (GitHub)
  * inline front/back page from cover file (create new release pdf)
  * create GIT tag
  * create github release; upload release pdf

GENERAL STYLE
====================================================================================================
* bring more personal stories (anecdotes); make it relatable/personal
  * hat happened in toms classes, martial arts, other dance classes (any movement or non-movement related)
  * inspire/motivate (like chen yinchung back then)
* be objective, be balanced injudgments
  * don't express personal opinions too much (watch out for emotional triggers)
  * point out the goods/bads of both sides
  * give empathy, be less attacking; compassion, try to understand "why they make this mistake" (going into an extreme/over-simplification)
  * provide solutions, tools, help to resolve it
  * e.g. remarks about feel/think, being in head while dancing; or flow/fun/feel/dance in general (choreography; no grounding/center-connection)
  * => when expressing personal opinion/preference, do so at the end of a chapter, explicitly highlighted as such
* follow a red thread
  * book's ultimate goal: for beginners (not profi/experienced); total noobs
  * watch out that it doesn't get too big (split afterward; maybe beginner VS experienced); less is more (30-100 pages)

PROMOTION - announce/marketing/PR
====================================================================================================
* tom's channels (whatsapp; classes; ask him to put in mailinglist)
* zaal 100
* facebook groups
* contact festival organizers; want to go there, sell and give away a few for free (gewinnspiel, fun, exercise)
* CI zagreb workshop-bootcamp people!
* contact quarterly? ECITE?
