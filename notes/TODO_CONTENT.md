* exercise attitude:
  * work with (collaborate), not against (compete) your partner
  * don't get satisfaction seeing them fail because you went too fast with them
  * pay attention where they are, where their limits are, and help them push those limits a bit
  * pay attention to which specifics they struggle, and explore, as in scratching the surface, making the corners clean, rounding them by brushing them
* ad dress code:
  * bare foot (more grip); no socks (sorry when it's cold); those socks with plastic nobs?! nah, not really.
* values:
  * no music; and if: more gentle ambient, chill music, soft, smooth (less beat and voice)
  * no smalltalk/chitchat during a jam, and also classes (soft voice; on the side)
  * no "parking" during a jam/class on the dancefloor
  * keep the flow; "a CI classicism": movements "should" be soft, flowing, sequential (good old bumpy times are over)
  * engage in physical contact as much as possible ;)
* as steve paxton would say, the floor is the 1st (3rd?) dance partner; when you dance alone, it's always a duette
  * but: i'd say the 3rd partner is the moment
  * don't fall in love with the partner, but with the dance (and definitely with the moment)
  * leading us to the principle of "empty mind"
  * CI is improvised, thus the name
  * it's not wanting/forcing, but "realizing potential"; seeing and taking a window of opportunity; if you are too late, don't hold on to it
  * it's a thin line, subtle differences, requires us to be fully aware; then CI becomes a mindfulness practice, a dynamic meditation, being fully in and with the moment, letting it shape (like daoism/taijiquan; wuwei, the non-doing doing; master does nothing, yet nothing undone)
  * let yourself be surprised by the moment
* one of the main skills: space awareness (peripheric vision)
  * obviously the ability to see the room and the people inside of it
    * important for safety reasons, not to bump with them, or step on their heads (while landing from a lift); thus having eyes always open!
  * less obvious: jedi skill; unconscious internal map of all other around; keeping track of their position and movement, so not to bump
  * a bit like driving a car, on the highway, a 360 degrees radar, knowing where which car is, approximately which speed... all being calculated in the unconscious mind
* "hire attitude, not skill": a total beginner can be amazing to dance with, no technical skill required, but basic attitude of patience (slow), listening (together), and sensitivity (details)
* an under-represented field in classes/workshops: more techniques (lifts) in trios
* principles: most don't have it; esp. when it comes to floorwork; they are gone, because they are also super diffiuclt
  * staying connected is difficult => use hookos/leverage; your downfall, my uprise
* legs have to be like arms: light, free, moveable
  * able to send (manipulate) and recieve (listen, sensitivity)
  * requires a lot of balance; and stay relaxed
* old-school CI: doing small-dance for warm-up at least 15 minutes
  * similar to taijiquan standing meditation
* when in contact with someone
  * feel their small dance
  * feel their grounding
* "empty mind" main principle
  * like of a zen master
* PRINCIPLES recape: groudning, sharing/pouring weight, RPoC, pathway continuation, center connection, empty mind
* basics: only interesting to beginners or very advanced; the intermediate get bored
* when fall, be soft, melting around the impact
  * like cars, being "software/shapeable/malable" these days
  * when falling into partner, fall soft
  * override fear response (tensing up; "muscle shields"); relax deeply, no tension; but also don't do semi-kamikaze
* oldschool CI: professionals + thick mats
  * today: amateurs + hard floor
  * also: it became much mor soft, safer (attitude calmed down; no more aggressive exploration)
* TODO: sub-chapter: "the art of falling"
* ad semi-kamikaza: trust your partner, yourself more
  * always be able to _catch yourself_ (when falling, doing more trickery fancy stuff)
* ad about me: CI for me is a spiritual practice. the way i'm doing taijiquan, or any zen practice; allowing the moment to express itself, through me, without wanting. a practice to adhere universal principles, applied philosophy through body
  * not about fun/joy (maybe nice side effects), to workout, to dance, look good/aesthetics, or get better in technical skills (all side effects)
  * but to realize nature's fundamental laws with my own body, adhere those, be more aligned with them
* old-school CI: just a temporary exploration phase, not meant to be taken as a reference/a source/a guide on "how it is supposed to be done"
  * exploration/research is always investigative, like brainstorming, trying things with the upfront knowledge/certainty of "failing"
  * thus, not valid to use the video footage from the 80s to refer to them as "the authentic original way to do it"
  * besides the fact that these people were extremely fit, well-trained professionals (mostly strong men), using thick mats for safe landing (also they knew how to fall safely)
  * throwing oneself onto the other, maybe also as its done nowadays in acrobatics, lacks the principles, the essence of current CI (listening, sharing/pouring weight, RPoC). it lacks sensitivity. it is fun indeed, but it's not CI anymore. use the principles to guide you what's inside and what's outside; be conscious about when crossing that boundary
* ad mastery: metaphor in taijiquan, the form being scaffold, not the goal; goal is to paint the house, letting go of the scaffold (the form); being free, only relying on principles
* chapter about "the art of falling"...
* how to find new pathways: let your partner take control of you (exercises; total follow; being manipulated)
  * DESORIENTATION; move the head wildly, counter-intuitively, spinning up and around; not knowing where you are anymore
  * requires your partner to be trustworthy, present with you, to be there to catch you
  * if engage in desorientation strongly, you can't catch yourself anymore, totally off-balance (hopefully good with falling)
* enter a dance (social)
  * first have your eyes into the space; find a "matching" partner
  * get closer in distance, orbit around them, make your intentions clear; a very clear "YES", no maybe, no hesitation; a vulnerable place to be, as might get rejected; deal with it, you will survive; find another one
  * dance in the negative space, adjust each other's movements; connect visually to center, read his skills/level
  * when establishing the intention to connect: slow down very much; breathe
  * then have direct, physical contact; and again: slow down, deep exhale
  * first thing to do: start slow ;) check principles (weight, center), and slowly build it up
    * travel, technqiues, change of level, lifts
* peripher vision: seeing without looking
  * not holding on with eyes; leave them open, spaceious, all seeing
* when moving too fast, center connection gets disrupted/lost
* social: when needs/qualities differ fundamentally during a dance...
  * eg: one is super slow and connected, other super fast and into trickery only
  * try non-verbally to communicate, stay authentic with your style, and invite the other to come to you, stay "stubborn"
  * adapt yourself to the other person's needs (and abandon your own? middle ground/compromise?)
  * simply leave; thank you and bye bye (don't come up with lies, as in "i need to drink something")
  * talk, simple as that; express observations/needs, not judge/diagnose the other (what doing wrong)
* lifting: first the principles/foundation, weight/connection, rolling (not sliding)
  * check/verify connection is good, by leaning away, and check whether partner is filling space without a break (no space in between, no deliberate decision required, as constant giving weight; like in daoism the water)
* ad consent: sometimes, when man+woman dance, the non-obvious is the case: the woman feels insulted/annoyed by the man constantly avoiding certain body parts of hers; as if they were not ok, not welcome
  * making a big thing of something, either by overly desiring it, or overly avoiding it, we create tension
  * like in shiatsu: touch it, without making a big fuzz out of it, and the other will also perceive it as such
* ad mastery: shu ha ri / dunning kruger / 4 levels un-conscious non-skill
  * "you can do whatever, as long as you know what you are doing"
  * deliberately stepping out of CI, once you know it's boundaries well (principles) 
* motto: "if you don't fall, you are doing something wrong"
  * my yoga teacher, but also my manager in business
  * if always staying safe, not out of comfort zone, no growth
  * the path to success is plastered with failure (graphic: two lines; vs tree like structure)
  * success is not the absence of failure, but its presence
  * "the master has failed more often than the student even has tried"
* the head-roll technique, works better when being bold ;)
* when things dont go according to the plan, not as expected => you are on the right path, great, you improvise/surprise yourself (as long as it is safe&sane)
* as a base, when lifting, always stay alive/dynamic/move
  * constantly adapt to your flyer, support/help him; e.g. to keep balance, to go down; work with him, pay attention, "be in your head"
  * keep your legs moving, take steps, keep moving the dance
* beginners use hands&arms
  * advanced connect via the box/torso/center
  * even more advanced use the legs/feet to pedipulate (vs manipulate; manus = hand, pedes = foot)
* mastery: going fast/wild/crazy, while maintaining the quality/basics/principles
* motto: "you can always be too fast, but never too slow"
* ad social: it's like in zouk: take veeeery long time to get to know a new partner
  * share a very slow dance first, stay stationary and feel (breath)
  * check the basic principles, feel, create awareness for each other; "lala land connection", get attuned (takes some time)
  * no moving/travelling at first, no techniques/lifts for a very long time
    * only when enough trust is established, A) technical (you are grounded, firm support, don't do weird stuff, pay attention, don't go beyond your level/overestimate your skills, listen to me/doing it together, proper body shapes/good gorilla) and B) personally (your personality matches mine, we find each other, like each other, allow each other in; building in-to-me-see)
* saying "no" to lift invites, feels like taking away candy/lolly from a kid during halloween; strangely pleasurable, gives an evil smile, the disappointment in the other caused, the empowerment feeling it gives to oneself ;)
* small dance, not only standing alone, but also during partner dance, even while lifting
  * need to be suuuper slow to really feel it
  * just like in life in general; tantra wisdom/motto: "to go deep, you need to go slow"
  * like in mindfulness, the glass with dirt particles in it: "to get clarity, we need stilness"
* the anti-rules: (ad skill/principles/social/safety)
  * pouring weight: don't jump on/off your partner; the change of pressure in contact should be gradual (no sharp/quick changes)
  * rolling point of contact (with considerable sharing weight, no butterfly touch): maintain surface contact in a continuous, uninterrupted line (no sliding/rubbing, especially no caressing); face is sensitive
  * we usually don't have any eye contact; maybe while initiating a quick smile and confirm "yes, i mean you" to avoid misunderstandings "do you mean me?"
  * we usually start back2back and don't dance frontal; we move with physics, we celebrate the dance; we don't fall in love with the partner, but see him as a physical object in space (just like the floor or a wall, but moving)
  * we walk (and land) without making any sound (little elephants); smooth feet, relaxed; zero impact
  * when sensitive body areas (genitals, breasts, butts) unintentionally were touched, we don't make a big thing out of it; not saying, not changing
  * we primarily use our torso (box = everything between shoulders and hips), very little to never the hands; we definitely don't grab or interlock or hold onto feet, but we use hooks for leverage (chicken wings/legs)
  * we wear casual comfortable clothes; not too much skin exposed (prevents sliding on the floor), we are barefoot (more grip), stretchy clothes (mobility; no jeans), and nothing firm/hard materials that stick out (buttons; painful when lifting); no accessoirs or jewlery of any kind
  * we stay silent as much as possible; no casual talking; obviously we don't use your phone
* the antirules insights: (some of it to mastery)
  * it gives more freedom, peace of mind, as no rules dictate doing it right/wrong; less anxiety/stress/tension/expectations
  * regulate the wildness; also the psycho-social impact will drain energy quickly
  * can the rules be broken in a more subtle way, without going into wild/crazy mode? stay gentle and slow, still break them?
  * if CI can be still identified as such, even when breaking the rules, that must mean the rules are not the essence of CI; what's the essence? gentle, rolling, continuation, using momentum... thus, a clear separation between (local) rules/principles and (global) essence/core
  * new-school CI is boring: only just slow, gentle, fluid, correct, predictable... it's too stuff, snobby, elitaire. the crazy wilderness adds some liveliness, surprises to it.
  * wild style must be only the advanced level, after having established a firm base in the (calm, round, slow, gentle) basics. its a mandatory sequence, and the foundation must not be skipped (not going into wild immediately). we need to be able to go back to the (slow) basics when needed (safety, exhaustion).
  * breaking the rules consciously adds a surprise moment, making us awake, shaking our expectations, and can be amazingly fun. we are advanced, we know when to step back into it again to also make it safe (support your partner, anticipate, be present).
  * little to gain (in terms of research/exploration) by simply going into a completely different dance/movement style. how to gain then? by staying a fair amount within CI, and every now and then break out of it.
  * it increases awareness, due to deliberately break a rule every now and then. resist the impulse to follow the rule and let an additional "command layer" dictate the opposite. internally scanning for what's right, and then do something else consciously instead. an intentional/deliberate rule break is not a mistake, only an unintentional is a mistake.
* ad safety: when practicing the crazy wild shit. fast, jumps, (shoulder) lifts: regulate your adrenaline/eagerness. keep pauses between attempts to "refresh", staying focused. start slowly, increase slowly (like weight lifting), to prevent injury. be honest, dont over estimate yourself/your skill. ask yourself: is it worth it? injury, pain, blocked for weeks/months, surgery, death? (how many people died from CI?).
* ad social: trust with your partner
  * trust requires connection
    * if you wanna go wild&crazy with someone (lifts, acrobatics), I first need to feel your groundedness, your center, us being connected
  * trust by hearing me; my needs, me saying "no"
    * only if you hear and respect my "no", i might give you my "yes"; like a precious baby i trust you; are you reliable? can i lie on you?
* when more advanced: center connection will be lighter
  * a too heavy center-connection makes stiff and rigid (not adaptable/flexible)
  * but for the beginning, better to be stiff+grounded, instead of unstabled+relaxed
* much can be inferred by using sex as an analogy (our behavior)
  * go slow, feeling is actually possible; going to fast, you don't know what's happening (can't sense it, yourself and the other)
* a scientist's attitude during practicing/researching/labbing (exercises in classes/workshops)
  * not trying to succeed, but to explore; to gain more insights (like in weight lifting: not reps, but stimuli matters)
  * 98% will be failure, 2% will be astonishing new findings
  * trying to succeed (keeping it safe, trying to be "good", prevent failing) will block you in your progress/exploration
* hooks:
  * always be able to do it without; then you have choice, but don't rely on it
  * same with grabbing: as an advanced, you can use it, because you are able to do it without; but don't do it as a beginner, as you are not yet able to do it without
  * it must be a choice, not a necessity
  * hooks are often a way to cheat, because of lack of skill (not centered/balanced)
  * common active hooking spots: pelvis, armpit, neck
* push firmly into partner's structure/architecture: to take away weight for your base
  * like a bent knee/pelvis... straight down into the ground
* ad about: my approach, very "masculine" to movement
  * masculine:
    * technical, pragmatic, function(al), progress, getting etter/mastery, winning, result-oriented, goal
    * effort, materialistic, literal, efficient/effective
    * focused/laser beam, straight line, edge, separated, analyzed/dissected
    * contained/controlled, research/exploration, serious, dedication, discipline
  * feminine:
    * fun, (en-)joy, pleasure, the path is the goal, process-oriented
    * aesthetics, pretty, beauty, together, community, bonding, social
    * uncontrolled, party, fast, wild, extrovert, energetic, chaos, spread, around
    * soul, heart, emotions, "energies", circular, round, holistic
* ad bodysurf: safe yourself,when flyer too close to knees or head -> lift head/arms or legs to adjust their position
* Somatics (wikiepdia): is a field within bodywork and movement studies which emphasizes internal physical perception and experience. The term is used in movement therapy to signify approaches based on the soma, or "the body as perceived from within", including Skinner
* ad grounding:
  * for good practice, always keep both feet fully on the ground with contact, slide over the ground, even heels and toes. advantage: if sudden shift of weight happens (from partner or yourself) then no bump (little elephant) and immediately stable. if would take big lifting step, and then weight, would "drop/fall" with impact (unstable!. slowly transition to hover over the ground. maintain constantly rather bent knees, to lower CoM, and also to be more adaptable/flexible (no stiff stick legs).
  * it is a principle, but actually a movement quality (mention in book)
* ad about: it's partly a community thing, as it's a result of my notes what has been shared in classes/workshop by other people. from the people, for the people. many of my lessons learned are "passing throughs" from my teachers. thus, i cannot own it, i shall not sell it for profit, but only give back what has been inspired (not really "taken", same as any information, whether an idea or a hollywood movie, can't be stolen, just copied/multiplied).
* ad jargon: new animal: crab (opposite of octopus; more edgy/stacciato with more muscle tension)
* in somatic approaches based on BMC (Body-Mind Centering),... human embryonic development
* ad jargon: resembles yoga asanas (taijiquan postures); good/bad gorilla like up/down dog (Urdhva/Adho Mukha Svanasana)
* mastery: never stop unintentionally (when lifting, etc.; gorilla, little animal; no time for the other to crawl onto us but just "slide")
  * if there is a pause/stillness/silence, it is a deliberate spice, but not a technical necessity, not breaking the flow/continuation
* floorwork most underestimated skill.
  * (shoulder)lifts are comparatively easy, and all the other apparently fancy tricks.
  * hiccups in lifts show themselves much easier, than in floorwork; thus our judgment is distorted.
  * as so often, we usually go into a mode of "fooling around" rather than doing something that has anything to do with CI
  * use the principles to evaluate: grounding, sharing weight, rolling point of contact, pathway continuation.
  * in floorwork, the (center) connection is lost most of the time, thus no sharing weight.
  * we often slide over each others body, trying to reconnect in a clumsy way, thus no rolling point of contact.
  * it needs more locking centers to each other, like glued.
  * it needs more easygoingness with intimacy, being very very close, cuddly.
  * it needs more pushing into the ground, not only taking weight off your partner, giving air, but also "moving into" quicker/on time.
  * it needs more daring to give weight, to maintain the connection ("am i too much?"), but also take away weight in the right time, on the right spot, e.g., when the partner needs to get up (e.g. into little animal)
* beginners are not "boring to dance with" as an advanced.
  * the to contrary: they can be amazingly great to dance with. new inspiration. not blinded to the system.
  * BUT: they often overestimate their skill. beginners who think they are intermediate are uncomfortable/annoying to dance with, and sometimes even dangerous.
  * it's ok to be bad at certain skills, its not ok to not be willing to acknowledge it and believe the opposite
  * beginner's mind, in such way, to always consider one can still improve, even though one has already built an identity around it
    * training to relax for 15 years, and then being told you are not relaxed, hurts the ego; at the same time, it allows to (finally) grow truly into mastery
    * the desire to feel good, to be happy, no matter the costs, prevents us from true growth and development, and forces us to stay in a beginner's skill level
* fly bird land cat workshop description:
  * One of the best compliments a contact dancer can receive is – “you are light as a feather”, another good indication to one technique is how we land on the floor, both these partners (the human one and the floor beneath our feet) teaches us how to refine our movement and dance. In this Intensive Contact Improvisation workshop we will practice and investigate how to be light as a feather and to land quietly on the floor like a cat, we will learn to use our entire body – muscles, bones and joints in order to achieve this not so easy task.
  * By understanding different pathways in space and inside the body one can learn to refine his/her movement capabilities. Seeing spirals pathways as a way up to the air and down to the ground, realizing that one can influence the “heaviness” quality of his/her body and change it in order to be grounded or to be lifted.
  * In this workshop we will experience and explore how we can override our fear reactions into a free form, dancing and extending it into flying. By the end of the workshop we will see how we will be flying on a partner in a safe way, and how to feel secure and to ride this flow even in a less secure situations, which in the past might have brought our reflexes and reactions to burst out.
* ad definition:
  * to capture its essence; without it, it's not it anymore (a knife without its blade); it can't do what it is meant to do by its very nature
  * to set it apart (separate); solely based on its definition it should be recognized
    * "a movement practice" includes too much; "partner dance" (maybe less, yet missing its essence); what makes it it, and what can be cut off without losing its "itness"
  * steve paxton once said: "Tennis is too big, imagine ping-pong; then make the net lower, the ball and racket smaller; then move closer to your opponent. Finally, dispense with net, table, racket, ball, competitiveness. What you have left is a close play between bodies, giving and taking weight."
  * it is: art-sport, a social dance, animal play, a physical dialogue
* ad mastery: advanced, seasoned performers/practitioners
* It’s rumored Steve Paxton created the small dance when he traveled to the dance studio on the subway. His feet rooted to the spot and his hand anchored to a strap suspended from the ceiling. As the subway carriage sways about, his pelvis and spine sway gently … hence the small dance.
* ad definition, Encyclopedia of Dance says: "primarily a duet form (the most basic unit of social interaction) that emphasizes the qualities of mutual trust and interdependence by requiring ongoing contact between the two participants"
* small dance is the micro movement of the body's balancing, adjusting, sensing and responding to gravity
* CI is like: place for shared experience and meaningful interactions; reliable source of joy; laboratory for communication; venue for self-exploration; spiritual path; form of social dance; sexual interaction; conversation; form of child-like play; type of healing; immersion into sensation; interplay of touch, the body's reflexes, and the floor [https://contactquarterly.com/cq/unbound/index.php#view=cqwebtext-daniel-halkin]
  * yet, for everyone it's different. if sharing afterwards how it was, people have so much different experiences
  * experiences influenced by: temperament, experiences, physically/emotionally/spiritually state, environment (people around us; in contact with)
  * acknowledge the subjectivity of our perceptions of reality; "listen in order to understand, not in order to reply" (be curious); we don't have to agree, but we have to acknowledge
* CI = "black sheep of the dance world"
* ad dresscode: pyjamas ;)
* ad about book: its USP, different from other books: more practical, technical, clear, simple, down to earth; less poetic/artistic/imaginary; nothing to motivate or dream, but something to understand and structure; to keep the balance, as the artistic dance world seems to be too much yin, thus to nourish the yang
* ad definition:
  * researching the language of the skin
  * it was characteristic for the first generation of CI-dancers to decide not to define contact improvisation, and not to set up a certification teacher training
  * it can look like a gentle wrestling
  * meditative mode of heightened perception, and nonverbal communication
* ad small dance, nancy says: "It was basically standing still and releasing tension and turning your attention to notice the small reflexive activity that the body makes to keep itself balanced and not fall over. You’re not doing it, but you’re noticing what it’s doing."
  * concept of noticing interior movement, foundational for contact improvisation.
* safety: know how to roll; front/back/side, handstand; invent, be creative
* CI has no formal educational path; no central authority; and on purpose resisting definition
  * is it even a dance?
  * how is it different from: Body-Mind Centering, or yoga, or other partnering forms, or release technique?
  * clear feel for the basic premise, develop a few safety skills, and get your reflexes primed and ready, then you’re off
  * improvisation is an essential part of the work—not just to learn steps or moves and put them together, but to meet, make, discover, and be curious.
* CI is fun, is serious, is playful, is disciplined, paying attention for long time, stay focused/mindfulness training/meditation practice (aware of point of contact)
  * wandering minds -> losing point of contact (is this what people refer to as "in their heads"?!)
  * and as in mindfulness training: You’re somewhere else. You realize, acknowledge it, gently. And then you come back.
* CI is working in spherical, not frontal space; difficult for performances, like in theaters were audience sees from only one side
* ad about me: not a dancer; i think of it as a beneficial thing, fresh wind into a dusted room; new perspectives; more approachable for the "common people" (not only exclusive to the formally trained dancers); also a good balance for the mostly feminine approach to CI via dance
  * also: i strongly believe CI, in order to maximize its reach, it should be free from any political or social or any other related topics; it's a movement practice, and as such it has the possibility to unite people, bring them together; once we pick i side, we also instantly leave out the other side, becoming more exclusive, isolated, and separating this world even more
* improvisation: "are we training to get better at doing what our partner expects us to do or at being ready to be surprised and respond to something we didn’t expect?"
* essence of CI (according to earthdance):
  * Contact—connection, touch, caring, right relationship
  * Improvisation—chaos, emergence, anarchy, experimentation, play, creativity; a tolerance and even an affection for uncertainty and paradox
  * Awareness—contemplation, listening, silence, feedback, focus, communication
  * Resilient Balance—a vital holism that comes from working with polarities: yielding and supporting, following and leading, listening and acting, giving and receiving
* what they call flow, i call using momentum; a pure energy efficient way of moving, to use falling force and continuing it (instead of breaking it; the (movement) pattern); 
* ad social; engaging in a dance; joining an existing duo, or the usual inviting a single person: even though when i feel initially a no, when you are careful enough, i might change my no into a yes
  * go slowly; be careful; make me feel seen, thus make me feel safe; listen; don't be pushy, don't take, but offer/give; present yourself, give space, and let come to you; acting out of love is an act of giving, thinking "what can i do for you", and not selfishly wanting to take something from me
  * story: man wants woman, goes to her place, knocks at the door; "who is it", and he replies "it's me", she sends him away, not enough space; ... time passes, he comes again, knocks; she asks "who is it" and now he answers "it's you" and she opens the door.
* ad definition: sport is too competitive, too much ego feeding. dance is too much about aesthetics/looking good, too much ego feeding. mindful movements, the intention inwards, to sense more (not achieve more, going faster/higher/stronger, more complex&impressive techniques), to slow down, to connect. 
* ad standing/small dance; steve says (from video "fall after newton"): "Standing still is not actually "still". Balancing on two legs deomsntrates ... dancer's body that one moves with gravity, always. Observing the const dancer's body that one moves with gravity, always. Observing the constant adjustments the body makes to keep from falling calms the whole being. It is a medita-tion. It is watching the reflexes at work, knowing they are subtle and dependable not just emergency measures.
  Standing became one of our disciplines, keeping the mind attentive to the body's present moment. This simple practice was preparation for the complex interactions that would arise with a partner. "
* ad pauses:
  * good pause: deliberate decision; to create space, to let something new/fresh emerge; a stylistic element; maybe also good to remind your partner (if needed) to listen more carefully; to recenter
  * bad pause: when being a base, to execute a steril technique as practiced in a laboratory; instead, keep on moving, stepping, rolling, doing; never end, like the infinity of a spiral
* ad definition:
  * shared leadership: both are leading together (not like that it's "leaderless"); a collaboration
  * a bit like an ideal marriage: 3 things i take responsibility over: myself, my partner, and the relationship between of us (and hopefully my partner is doing the same)
* ad physics: newtonian physics missing the human aspect; too objective, and nothing about how humans subjectively experience it (including the psychological realm: thoughts, feelings); how we perceive and relate to it
* when lifting, the principle of "center connection" gets a new meaning, a super important one: keep your lifted partner very close to your main axis, the vertical one going into the ground; your center line. thus, bone structure carries the weight, not muscle tension (too effortful).
* ad "tension masks/covers sensation": can't feel gravity, can't tell if you are falling (and then it's too late)
  * too loose is also not good
  * don't be too tight, don't be committed to a shape
  * be in movement, and organize "around the support"; relax, and work with it
* in CI, the weight we give is support structure; we kind-a rely on each other (opposed to other partner dance forms)
* trust is not blind faith, mere guessing; train your senses (lots of practice), and feel that it (the support) is there
* touch is crucial; our motivation; good for health (see babies and touch)
  * in our society, touch is only available with sexuality or violence
* ad definition: improvised duet form. sometimes also more than 2. and their (combined) relationship to the physical laws (gravity, centrifugal force, momentum, friction, inertia) governing their motion.
* ad complementary practices to do: acro yoga can help for the technical stuff, flying/basing, balance, alignment. although it lacks dynamics, movement, some experience with it can be helpful (and can be well integrated in CI).
* ad definition: steve paxton didn't want to give a definition at the early beginning on; maybe some language, some words, but no clear definition, so people are free to describe what it was (for them); as many definitions as teachers
* "in order to do it well, you have to be listening very carefully to your partner's body" - Mike Varga
* most of CI's existence, there was no music; rarely maybe live musicians
  * the rhythm and musicality of the dialog between the two bodies is complex/particular, needs to be focused on for a long time; rhythm of falling/gravity
  * with strong-beat music, humans have a habit to move to that beat; it becomes the primary impulse (person becomes secondary); that's why ambient music is ok-ish (it will still "color the atmosphere" with its mood; no preferred blank canvas anymore we are free to paint whatever)
  * in CI, partner remains primary partner (source of impulse); and maybe gravity, but not music
* your attention needs to move faster than the bodies, otherwise you will miss out, it will hit you, accident and injury possible; thus, move the bodies so slowly, that your capacity for attention can keep up
* grazing: a series of short connections; like a cow eating grass on the field, eating here and there a bit, walking somewhere else, eating...; too short to develop to something (no engagement, no commitment); feeling of "i'm on my way (somewhere else)"; tasting like at a buffet to get stimulated; 
* definition: it's research and play; serious playfulness; playful investigation; with discipline and effort, yet effortless due to playfulness;
  * for most people in our world it seems strange, to be physically so intimate (in a non-sensual/non-sexual way; intimacy != sexuality; we can be intimate without sex, and we can have sex without intimacy), with strangers
    * BUT: there is this underlying assumption that strangers are bad, we shall not trust them, thus we don't "let them in"; an alienated, isolated, mistrusting way of looking at life and others.
    * contrary to the idea of "there are only brothers and sisters in this world"; we are all one, one family, one tribe, united, together (technically speaking that might be true; homo sapiens once almost died out, just a few ten-thousands; life itself rooted back to maybe a single life cell few billion years ago)
* "precedence of body experience first, and mindful cognition second, is an essential distinction between CI and other approaches to dance", by Danny Lepkoff
* nancy said: "Once you get a clear feel for the basic premise, develop a few safety skills, and get your reflexes primed and ready, then you're off. You learn by doing"

* the "closer" a system gets (more well defined, confined, limited), the easier it is to freely express/move, as we know what to expect/deal with
* to not freak out while whirling around; not losing oneself in disorientation
* if there is no definition, no principles/rules/techniques; if it is just "go with the flow and have fun, fooling around freely"; how is it different than anarchy? how is it any different from anything, without any clearly defined essence/substance? a boundary, thus being able to say what's inside/outside?
* CI is spherical, not 3 dimensions combined, left/right and up/down, but everything moving around you; senses experience space as a sphere, not just 3 (2D) flat planes, linear;
* ad definition: Upon entering a Contact Improv structure, two bodies must come together to create a point of contact (i.e., back to wrist, shoulder to thigh, head to foot, back to back, the options are endless), give weight equally to each other, and then create a movement dialog that can last for an undetermined amount of time, as long as both participants are fully engaged.
* "under-arcs", "fulcrums"
