* exercise attitude:
  * work with (collaborate), not against (compete) your partner
  * don't get satisfaction seeing them fail because you went too fast with them
  * pay attention where they are, where their limits are, and help them push those limits a bit
  * pay attention to which specifics they struggle, and explore, as in scratching the surface, making the corners clean, rounding them by brushing them
* ad dress code:
  * bare foot (more grip); no socks (sorry when it's cold); those socks with plastic nobs?! nah, not really.
* values:
  * no music; and if: more gentle ambient, chill music, soft, smooth (less beat and voice)
  * no smalltalk/chitchat during a jam, and also classes (soft voice; on the side)
  * no "parking" during a jam/class on the dancefloor
  * keep the flow; "a CI classicism": movements "should" be soft, flowing, sequential (good old bumpy times are over)
  * engage in physical contact as much as possible ;)
* as steve paxton would say, the floor is the 1st (3rd?) dance partner; when you dance alone, it's always a duette
  * but: i'd say the 3rd partner is the moment
  * don't fall in love with the partner, but with the dance (and definitely with the moment)
  * leading us to the principle of "empty mind"
  * CI is improvised, thus the name
  * it's not wanting/forcing, but "realizing potential"; seeing and taking a window of opportunity; if you are too late, don't hold on to it
  * it's a thin line, subtle differences, requires us to be fully aware; then CI becomes a mindfulness practice, a dynamic meditation, being fully in and with the moment, letting it shape (like daoism/taijiquan; wuwei, the non-doing doing; master does nothing, yet nothing undone)
  * let yourself be surprised by the moment
* one of the main skills: space awareness (peripheric vision)
  * obviously the ability to see the room and the people inside of it
    * important for safety reasons, not to bump with them, or step on their heads (while landing from a lift); thus having eyes always open!
  * less obvious: jedi skill; unconscious internal map of all other around; keeping track of their position and movement, so not to bump
  * a bit like driving a car, on the highway, a 360 degrees radar, knowing where which car is, approximately which speed... all being calculated in the unconscious mind
* "hire attitude, not skill": a total beginner can be amazing to dance with, no technical skill required, but basic attitude of patience (slow), listening (together), and sensitivity (details)
* an under-represented field in classes/workshops: more techniques (lifts) in trios
* principles: most don't have it; esp. when it comes to floorwork; they are gone, because they are also super diffiuclt
  * staying connected is difficult => use hookos/leverage; your downfall, my uprise
* legs have to be like arms: light, free, moveable
  * able to send (manipulate) and recieve (listen, sensitivity)
  * requires a lot of balance; and stay relaxed
* old-school CI: doing small-dance for warm-up at least 15 minutes
  * similar to taijiquan standing meditation
* when in contact with someone
  * feel their small dance
  * feel their grounding
* "empty mind" main principle
  * like of a zen master
* PRINCIPLES recape: groudning, sharing/pouring weight, RPoC, pathway continuation, center connection, empty mind
* basics: only interesting to beginners or very advanced; the intermediate get bored
* when fall, be soft, melting around the impact
  * like cars, being "software/shapeable/malable" these days
  * when falling into partner, fall soft
  * override fear response (tensing up; "muscle shields"); relax deeply, no tension; but also don't do semi-kamikaze
* oldschool CI: professionals + thick mats
  * today: amateurs + hard floor
  * also: it became much mor soft, safer (attitude calmed down; no more aggressive exploration)
* TODO: sub-chapter: "the art of falling"
* ad semi-kamikaza: trust your partner, yourself more
  * always be able to _catch yourself_ (when falling, doing more trickery fancy stuff)
* ad about me: CI for me is a spiritual practice. the way i'm doing taijiquan, or any zen practice; allowing the moment to express itself, through me, without wanting. a practice to adhere universal principles, applied philosophy through body
  * not about fun/joy (maybe nice side effects), to workout, to dance, look good/aesthetics, or get better in technical skills (all side effects)
  * but to realize nature's fundamental laws with my own body, adhere those, be more aligned with them
* old-school CI: just a temporary exploration phase, not meant to be taken as a reference/a source/a guide on "how it is supposed to be done"
  * exploration/research is always investigative, like brainstorming, trying things with the upfront knowledge/certainty of "failing"
  * thus, not valid to use the video footage from the 80s to refer to them as "the authentic original way to do it"
  * besides the fact that these people were extremely fit, well-trained professionals (mostly strong men), using thick mats for safe landing (also they knew how to fall safely)
  * throwing oneself onto the other, maybe also as its done nowadays in acrobatics, lacks the principles, the essence of current CI (listening, sharing/pouring weight, RPoC). it lacks sensitivity. it is fun indeed, but it's not CI anymore. use the principles to guide you what's inside and what's outside; be conscious about when crossing that boundary
* ad mastery: metaphor in taijiquan, the form being scaffold, not the goal; goal is to paint the house, letting go of the scaffold (the form); being free, only relying on principles
* chapter about "the art of falling"...
* how to find new pathways: let your partner take control of you (exercises; total follow; being manipulated)
  * DESORIENTATION; move the head wildly, counter-intuitively, spinning up and around; not knowing where you are anymore
  * requires your partner to be trustworthy, present with you, to be there to catch you
  * if engage in desorientation strongly, you can't catch yourself anymore, totally off-balance (hopefully good with falling)
* enter a dance (social)
  * first have your eyes into the space; find a "matching" partner
  * get closer in distance, orbit around them, make your intentions clear; a very clear "YES", no maybe, no hesitation; a vulnerable place to be, as might get rejected; deal with it, you will survive; find another one
  * dance in the negative space, adjust each other's movements; connect visually to center, read his skills/level
  * when establishing the intention to connect: slow down very much; breathe
  * then have direct, physical contact; and again: slow down, deep exhale
  * first thing to do: start slow ;) check principles (weight, center), and slowly build it up
    * travel, technqiues, change of level, lifts
* peripher vision: seeing without looking
  * not holding on with eyes; leave them open, spaceious, all seeing
* when moving too fast, center connection gets disrupted/lost
* social: when needs/qualities differ fundamentally during a dance...
  * eg: one is super slow and connected, other super fast and into trickery only
  * try non-verbally to communicate, stay authentic with your style, and invite the other to come to you, stay "stubborn"
  * adapt yourself to the other person's needs (and abandon your own? middle ground/compromise?)
  * simply leave; thank you and bye bye (don't come up with lies, as in "i need to drink something")
  * talk, simple as that; express observations/needs, not judge/diagnose the other (what doing wrong)
* lifting: first the principles/foundation, weight/connection, rolling (not sliding)
  * check/verify connection is good, by leaning away, and check whether partner is filling space without a break (no space in between, no deliberate decision required, as constant giving weight; like in daoism the water)
* ad consent: sometimes, when man+woman dance, the non-obvious is the case: the woman feels insulted/annoyed by the man constantly avoiding certain body parts of hers; as if they were not ok, not welcome
  * making a big thing of something, either by overly desiring it, or overly avoiding it, we create tension
  * like in shiatsu: touch it, without making a big fuzz out of it, and the other will also perceive it as such
* ad mastery: shu ha ri / dunning kruger / 4 levels un-conscious non-skill
  * "you can do whatever, as long as you know what you are doing"
  * deliberately stepping out of CI, once you know it's boundaries well (principles) 
* motto: "if you don't fall, you are doing something wrong"
  * my yoga teacher, but also my manager in business
  * if always staying safe, not out of comfort zone, no growth
  * the path to success is plastered with failure (graphic: two lines; vs tree like structure)
  * success is not the absence of failure, but its presence
  * "the master has failed more often than the student even has tried"
