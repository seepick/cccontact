* exercise attitude:
  * work with (collaborate), not against (compete) your partner
  * don't get satisfaction seeing them fail because you went too fast with them
  * pay attention where they are, where their limits are, and help them push those limits a bit
  * pay attention to which specifics they struggle, and explore, as in scratching the surface, making the corners clean, rounding them by brushing them
* ad dress code:
  * bare foot (more grip); no socks (sorry when it's cold); those socks with plastic nobs?! nah, not really.
* values:
  * no music; and if: more gentle ambient, chill music, soft, smooth (less beat and voice)
  * no smalltalk/chitchat during a jam, and also classes (soft voice; on the side)
  * no "parking" during a jam/class on the dancefloor
  * keep the flow; "a CI classicism": movements "should" be soft, flowing, sequential (good old bumpy times are over)
  * engage in physical contact as much as possible ;)
* as steve paxton would say, the floor is the 1st (3rd?) dance partner; when you dance alone, it's always a duette
  * but: i'd say the 3rd partner is the moment
  * don't fall in love with the partner, but with the dance (and definitely with the moment)
  * leading us to the principle of "empty mind"
  * CI is improvised, thus the name
  * it's not wanting/forcing, but "realizing potential"; seeing and taking a window of opportunity; if you are too late, don't hold on to it
  * it's a thin line, subtle differences, requires us to be fully aware; then CI becomes a mindfulness practice, a dynamic meditation, being fully in and with the moment, letting it shape (like daoism/taijiquan; wuwei, the non-doing doing; master does nothing, yet nothing undone)
  * let yourself be surprised by the moment
* one of the main skills: space awareness (peripheric vision)
  * obviously the ability to see the room and the people inside of it
    * important for safety reasons, not to bump with them, or step on their heads (while landing from a lift); thus having eyes always open!
  * less obvious: jedi skill; unconscious internal map of all other around; keeping track of their position and movement, so not to bump
  * a bit like driving a car, on the highway, a 360 degrees radar, knowing where which car is, approximately which speed... all being calculated in the unconscious mind
* "hire attitude, not skill": a total beginner can be amazing to dance with, no technical skill required, but basic attitude of patience (slow), listening (together), and sensitivity (details)
* an under-represented field in classes/workshops: more techniques (lifts) in trios
* principles: most don't have it; esp. when it comes to floorwork; they are gone, because they are also super diffiuclt
  * staying connected is difficult => use hookos/leverage; your downfall, my uprise
* legs have to be like arms: light, free, moveable
  * able to send (manipulate) and recieve (listen, sensitivity)
  * requires a lot of balance; and stay relaxed
* old-school CI: doing small-dance for warm-up at least 15 minutes
  * similar to taijiquan standing meditation
* when in contact with someone
  * feel their small dance
  * feel their grounding
* "empty mind" main principle
  * like of a zen master
* PRINCIPLES recape: groudning, sharing/pouring weight, RPoC, pathway continuation, center connection, empty mind
* basics: only interesting to beginners or very advanced; the intermediate get bored
* when fall, be soft, melting around the impact
  * like cars, being "software/shapeable/malable" these days
  * when falling into partner, fall soft
  * override fear response (tensing up; "muscle shields"); relax deeply, no tension; but also don't do semi-kamikaze
* oldschool CI: professionals + thick mats
  * today: amateurs + hard floor
  * also: it became much mor soft, safer (attitude calmed down; no more aggressive exploration)
* TODO: sub-chapter: "the art of falling"
* ad semi-kamikaza: trust your partner, yourself more
  * always be able to _catch yourself_ (when falling, doing more trickery fancy stuff)
* ad about me: CI for me is a spiritual practice. the way i'm doing taijiquan, or any zen practice; allowing the moment to express itself, through me, without wanting. a practice to adhere universal principles, applied philosophy through body
  * not about fun/joy (maybe nice side effects), to workout, to dance, look good/aesthetics, or get better in technical skills (all side effects)
  * but to realize nature's fundamental laws with my own body, adhere those, be more aligned with them
* old-school CI: just a temporary exploration phase, not meant to be taken as a reference/a source/a guide on "how it is supposed to be done"
  * exploration/research is always investigative, like brainstorming, trying things with the upfront knowledge/certainty of "failing"
  * thus, not valid to use the video footage from the 80s to refer to them as "the authentic original way to do it"
  * besides the fact that these people were extremely fit, well-trained professionals (mostly strong men), using thick mats for safe landing (also they knew how to fall safely)
  * throwing oneself onto the other, maybe also as its done nowadays in acrobatics, lacks the principles, the essence of current CI (listening, sharing/pouring weight, RPoC). it lacks sensitivity. it is fun indeed, but it's not CI anymore. use the principles to guide you what's inside and what's outside; be conscious about when crossing that boundary
* ad mastery: metaphor in taijiquan, the form being scaffold, not the goal; goal is to paint the house, letting go of the scaffold (the form); being free, only relying on principles
* chapter about "the art of falling"...
* how to find new pathways: let your partner take control of you (exercises; total follow; being manipulated)
  * DESORIENTATION; move the head wildly, counter-intuitively, spinning up and around; not knowing where you are anymore
  * requires your partner to be trustworthy, present with you, to be there to catch you
  * if engage in desorientation strongly, you can't catch yourself anymore, totally off-balance (hopefully good with falling)
* enter a dance (social)
  * first have your eyes into the space; find a "matching" partner
  * get closer in distance, orbit around them, make your intentions clear; a very clear "YES", no maybe, no hesitation; a vulnerable place to be, as might get rejected; deal with it, you will survive; find another one
  * dance in the negative space, adjust each other's movements; connect visually to center, read his skills/level
  * when establishing the intention to connect: slow down very much; breathe
  * then have direct, physical contact; and again: slow down, deep exhale
  * first thing to do: start slow ;) check principles (weight, center), and slowly build it up
    * travel, technqiues, change of level, lifts
* peripher vision: seeing without looking
  * not holding on with eyes; leave them open, spaceious, all seeing
* when moving too fast, center connection gets disrupted/lost
* social: when needs/qualities differ fundamentally during a dance...
  * eg: one is super slow and connected, other super fast and into trickery only
  * try non-verbally to communicate, stay authentic with your style, and invite the other to come to you, stay "stubborn"
  * adapt yourself to the other person's needs (and abandon your own? middle ground/compromise?)
  * simply leave; thank you and bye bye (don't come up with lies, as in "i need to drink something")
  * talk, simple as that; express observations/needs, not judge/diagnose the other (what doing wrong)
* lifting: first the principles/foundation, weight/connection, rolling (not sliding)
  * check/verify connection is good, by leaning away, and check whether partner is filling space without a break (no space in between, no deliberate decision required, as constant giving weight; like in daoism the water)
* ad consent: sometimes, when man+woman dance, the non-obvious is the case: the woman feels insulted/annoyed by the man constantly avoiding certain body parts of hers; as if they were not ok, not welcome
  * making a big thing of something, either by overly desiring it, or overly avoiding it, we create tension
  * like in shiatsu: touch it, without making a big fuzz out of it, and the other will also perceive it as such
* ad mastery: shu ha ri / dunning kruger / 4 levels un-conscious non-skill
  * "you can do whatever, as long as you know what you are doing"
  * deliberately stepping out of CI, once you know it's boundaries well (principles) 
* motto: "if you don't fall, you are doing something wrong"
  * my yoga teacher, but also my manager in business
  * if always staying safe, not out of comfort zone, no growth
  * the path to success is plastered with failure (graphic: two lines; vs tree like structure)
  * success is not the absence of failure, but its presence
  * "the master has failed more often than the student even has tried"
* the head-roll technique, works better when being bold ;)
* when things dont go according to the plan, not as expected => you are on the right path, great, you improvise/surprise yourself (as long as it is safe&sane)
* as a base, when lifting, always stay alive/dynamic/move
  * constantly adapt to your flyer, support/help him; e.g. to keep balance, to go down; work with him, pay attention, "be in your head"
  * keep your legs moving, take steps, keep moving the dance
* beginners use hands&arms
  * advanced connect via the box/torso/center
  * even more advanced use the legs/feet to pedipulate (vs manipulate; manus = hand, pedes = foot)
* mastery: going fast/wild/crazy, while maintaining the quality/basics/principles
* motto: "you can always be too fast, but never too slow"
* ad social: it's like in zouk: take veeeery long time to get to know a new partner
  * share a very slow dance first, stay stationary and feel (breath)
  * check the basic principles, feel, create awareness for each other; "lala land connection", get attuned (takes some time)
  * no moving/travelling at first, no techniques/lifts for a very long time
    * only when enough trust is established, A) technical (you are grounded, firm support, don't do weird stuff, pay attention, don't go beyond your level/overestimate your skills, listen to me/doing it together, proper body shapes/good gorilla) and B) personally (your personality matches mine, we find each other, like each other, allow each other in; building in-to-me-see)
* saying "no" to lift invites, feels like taking away candy/lolly from a kid during halloween; strangely pleasurable, gives an evil smile, the disappointment in the other caused, the empowerment feeling it gives to oneself ;)
* small dance, not only standing alone, but also during partner dance, even while lifting
  * need to be suuuper slow to really feel it
  * just like in life in general; tantra wisdom/motto: "to go deep, you need to go slow"
  * like in mindfulness, the glass with dirt particles in it: "to get clarity, we need stilness"
* the anti-rules: (ad skill/principles/social/safety)
  * pouring weight: don't jump on/off your partner; the change of pressure in contact should be gradual (no sharp/quick changes)
  * rolling point of contact (with considerable sharing weight, no butterfly touch): maintain surface contact in a continuous, uninterrupted line (no sliding/rubbing, especially no caressing); face is sensitive
  * we usually don't have any eye contact; maybe while initiating a quick smile and confirm "yes, i mean you" to avoid misunderstandings "do you mean me?"
  * we usually start back2back and don't dance frontal; we move with physics, we celebrate the dance; we don't fall in love with the partner, but see him as a physical object in space (just like the floor or a wall, but moving)
  * we walk (and land) without making any sound (little elephants); smooth feet, relaxed; zero impact
  * when sensitive body areas (genitals, breasts, butts) unintentionally were touched, we don't make a big thing out of it; not saying, not changing
  * we primarily use our torso (box = everything between shoulders and hips), very little to never the hands; we definitely don't grab or interlock or hold onto feet, but we use hooks for leverage (chicken wings/legs)
  * we wear casual comfortable clothes; not too much skin exposed (prevents sliding on the floor), we are barefoot (more grip), stretchy clothes (mobility; no jeans), and nothing firm/hard materials that stick out (buttons; painful when lifting); no accessoirs or jewlery of any kind
  * we stay silent as much as possible; no casual talking; obviously we don't use your phone
* the antirules insights: (some of it to mastery)
  * it gives more freedom, peace of mind, as no rules dictate doing it right/wrong; less anxiety/stress/tension/expectations
  * regulate the wildness; also the psycho-social impact will drain energy quickly
  * can the rules be broken in a more subtle way, without going into wild/crazy mode? stay gentle and slow, still break them?
  * if CI can be still identified as such, even when breaking the rules, that must mean the rules are not the essence of CI; what's the essence? gentle, rolling, continuation, using momentum... thus, a clear separation between (local) rules/principles and (global) essence/core
  * new-school CI is boring: only just slow, gentle, fluid, correct, predictable... it's too stuff, snobby, elitaire. the crazy wilderness adds some liveliness, surprises to it.
  * wild style must be only the advanced level, after having established a firm base in the (calm, round, slow, gentle) basics. its a mandatory sequence, and the foundation must not be skipped (not going into wild immediately). we need to be able to go back to the (slow) basics when needed (safety, exhaustion).
  * breaking the rules consciously adds a surprise moment, making us awake, shaking our expectations, and can be amazingly fun. we are advanced, we know when to step back into it again to also make it safe (support your partner, anticipate, be present).
  * little to gain (in terms of research/exploration) by simply going into a completely different dance/movement style. how to gain then? by staying a fair amount within CI, and every now and then break out of it.
  * it increases awareness, due to deliberately break a rule every now and then. resist the impulse to follow the rule and let an additional "command layer" dictate the opposite. internally scanning for what's right, and then do something else consciously instead. an intentional/deliberate rule break is not a mistake, only an unintentional is a mistake.
* ad safety: when practicing the crazy wild shit. fast, jumps, (shoulder) lifts: regulate your adrenaline/eagerness. keep pauses between attempts to "refresh", staying focused. start slowly, increase slowly (like weight lifting), to prevent injury. be honest, dont over estimate yourself/your skill. ask yourself: is it worth it? injury, pain, blocked for weeks/months, surgery, death? (how many people died from CI?).
