* a proper "exercise attitude"
  * active research is different than "simply dancing/enjoying", simply applying it (application), having fun/pleasure
  * it makes the dance "bumpy", less good, less pleasant; it's meant to be!
  * this is where growth happens, outside th eknown/the habits/the comfort-zone; into the learning zone
  * less pleasing also for the partner; don't be afraid to do mistakes (ego; self-worth); less showing off
* in partner exercises, think for your partner
  * the signal you send, the specific challenge you choose (which body part, which command)
  * being a good exercise partner by being aware on a meta-level; to think ahead, and know what and why you are doing
  * "foerdern durch fordern"; to support by challenge; stay in proximal development area (in learning zone; not comfort, not panic zone)
* "in my head"
  * what it means: to have distracting thoughts, unproductive, irrelevant here
  * yet, don't confuse with focused attention; being present, with "heart and brain", with "body and head"; united
  * if growth is relevant, then it is effortful
  * stages
    * as a beginner: just fun, effortless, chaotic
    * intermediate: hard effortfull work, precise, controlled
    * advanced: effortless, precise and controleld, or chaotic if choses to (knowing the risks)
    * like driving a car: as a child, pretend to drive, super fun, without effort, talking while doing; then doing hard work of exam for a driver license, having to practice and study theoretically, stress in traffic; and now as an adult again enjoying driving without even thinking about it, effortless, on auto pilot, as in "how did i get home?"
* when advanced look for beginners to dance with; something that happens often in the (professional) dance community:
  * they want to get inspired, breaking their habits/patterns; beginners are not yet too "biased" (betriebsblind); otherwise usually "incest" (like in martial arts)
  * to get back to the more (relevant) basic principles; they are bored by the hoopedipoop-techniques (lifts)
* language metaphor:
  * beginners don't talk the language yet, still they try to say "something", so they just say random things; sometimes they are lucky, and say something of meaning, yet not knowing what the meaning of it is; an accident; something that will lead to a surprise
  * when I speak french, but you speak spanish, after some time of not being successful understanding each other, we simply switch back to the common denominator: gibberish. only (simple) tone/melody, making sounds (movement), but no (exclusive) words/grammar (lifts)
* "going fast is easy, going slow is difficult"
  * fast, mistakes can easily by covered up/masked; being off balance
  * slow, needs way more control
  * slow is everything zoomed in; the small hickups will be huge/visible
  * our fast mentality, expressed through movement
  * when you can do it slowly, you can do it fast
* "you see, you know immediately, whether someone got skill or not; you see their personality expressed; the flow, the talents... try to make it explicit. what is it precisely that makes them so? enumerate criteria"
* sensitivity (=the ability to listen) requires gentleness/softness. softness is minimum effort/tensions, min. engagement of muscle fibres
  * a higher-resolution of neuro-muscular connection. precision: 82% vs 82.3% of activation (tension). like kink-spanking: being able to hit with 40% vs 45%, to slowly expand the comfort zone. otherwise: danger, risk of injury, going too fast, breaking boundary, breaking a person, or at least a bone.
* too much wanting, forcing it. not enough openness, improvisation; being and listening what the moment want to unfold, letting yourself be surprised without anticipation.
* beginner's mistakes: // always describe what is wrong (observable facts), why it is wrong (dangers, inefficiencies) and tell what's better instead (what&why) AND: "nothing wrong, as long as know what you are doing"
  * off-balance, leaning (not sharing weight); like a plank, a diagonal shape; instead of bending knees and hips, and have upper body upright sharing into the shared center of mass.
  * lifts are often a matter of grabbing, with mere muscular force; instead of passively invite, moving the center underneath
* closing your yes is very much different; more perception, sensory capacity shifts from visual to tactile (like blind people hear more)
  * now try to move your head: losing sense of orientation (where's up/down), play with it (if you dare)
* motto: "limitation gives freedom"
  * sparkles creativity due to a necessity
  * total freedom is something we actually don't want, although we might scream for it; we humans like to have boundaries, to be kept safe in a cage

* 2 types of beginners:
  * 1) body beginners; in general no connection to their bodies, no experience in moving, sensing their body; they first need to learn to alphabet before studying shakespear, otherwise they will struggle a lot
  * 2) system beginners: people who have general skill in body stuff, but lack knowledge & experience in this specific system; they will catch up/learn very quickly

* what makes a beginner a beginner; how to identify, in clear/specific criteria:
  * 1) separation of body; especially arms isolated movement; no whole body integration; not leading from the center
  * 2) "circle sickness", once they learn rolling point of contact, they keep on doing it until dizzy; not yet have learned other wise to roll (instead of just rotating)
* unconscious processing of information, e.g. "sensing the center of your partner", or "sensing energy" (more generally what people, esp. women/hippies say), "sensing energy in the room" (when meant literally, as in some meta-physical substance being able to be perceived in some not yet known sensory organ; instead of the more likely event of being unaware of the unconscious processing of regular sensory information; visual obviously, but also olfactory lots going on below conscious level; e.g. cave, bear, fear story); people just don't know any better, they explain it with romantic stories, because otherwise nothing available to explain it
* small dance: usually from regular standing, but also possible in any position (exception when fully relaxed lying down); search for the unstable/unbalanced position, to amplify it (the wobblying, the shaking)
  * even durin gwalking able to sense, short moment when one-legged, a subtle shake, that's it.
* when spiraling down from a lift, often we lead from the foot/toe, but try to lead from the pinky finger; will result in more extended (reaching) body posture, maybe it might feel even a bit more scary...
* in general, often under represented: leading from the finger; also engage eyes, actively, leading from them (will move the head implicitly, no other way)
* get to know your partner (their personality, thus their tendencies of movement), play with it
  * "ask questions and listen carefully", e.g. be more leading/dominant, check whether he is receptive to it, or pushing against it.
  * basically: send signals and await a response form it, forming a more copmlete picture of that person
* playing with architecture, like drawing, research, curoisity; esp. with 3+ dances, more possibilities arise to construct interesting shapes
  * take time to find possibilities in a specific posture/structure/architecture, to know where weight can be given (and where it can't); a crucial skill to have an eye for that
* "fast can be fun (and risky, and superficial), slow can lead to depth (heightened sensation, even intimacy), yet a pause leads to magic"
* develop smart feet, making no sounds, soft and controlled
* EXERCISE: partner is with his ear on the ground (maybe at first hand in between, otherwise too loud); eyes closed; other partner walks around, try to walk silently; then jumps and land soundless; partner on ground says "now" when hears landing; goal is that partner never has to say it
* the lift is not initiated by the flyer, but invited by the base.
  * not a forced action, but an open question (can be said yes or no to it)
  * not as in "i invite you to stand up", which is using fake-polite language, it's usually a command hiding itself behind a nice facade (wolf sheep fur)
  * when basing a lift, we invite/offer, and the flyer decides ultimately to accept it (or not; rejection feelings?!)
  * we don't "force them" by grabing them (acrobatics?! martial arts throw?!); it's disrespectful, takes away autonomy
  * yet, as with every rule; motto: "you can do whatever you want as long as you know what you are doing"; if you are advanced; know your partner very well; if it's a deliberate choice (and not an accident)
* we don't jump on a base, never, rude!
  * instead we pour our weight, or even better: we "melt" it.
* EXERCISE: little animal, other person pours his weight on the partner, animal eyes closed and says "now" if they think that flyer not touch ground anymore/take-off (be as soft as when landing after a jump, no hick-up/sharp edges)
  * Why?! in oldschool CI, they still do it (survival mode); but it's dangerous, big impact, requires a lot of skill to "survive", safe yourself.
* skill shows by moving without sound; like a big cat/tiger, elegant, fast, strong, powerful, soft, gentile; a silent killer
* ad motto: if you dont fall, you are doing something wrong. growth is about (controlled) failure, not success. find your limits, explore, and expand them.
* floorwork exercises. sit. tabletop. back. belly. ... each find edges. left, right. front, back. and then circle.
* skinesphere (add to glossary): like kinesphere (from laban's "space harmony"), but the skin surrounding the body
  * used for "grazing", a way in CI to say hello
* advanced practitioners like to join beginner classes (enjoying the basics again), intermediate don't
* "being in your head" = disproportional amount of thought, non-constructive cognitive effort
  * also: overly self-critical inner voice, based on self-doubt and insecurity (fear of failing)
    * yet, being critical itself is useful, even towards oneself, as it helps to get better, pointing out things, being integer (live up to one's own expectations)
  * in opposition to "purely sensing with open awareness, free of judgments"
* EXERCISE: tell partner "pause" and then { breathe - sense - ground }; take your time in-between the commands so your partner has some space to feel/experience
  * try different orders of those 3 and check the difference/impact
  * observer your partner when you tell him those things; any change visible?!
  * "pause" already breathing happening; with any breathing, already grounding happening; only sensing might be different and solely happening on the inside (nothing visible)
  * ground is relaxing, only downwards, breathe is expanding in all directions/inflating
  * when the position is a strong one (effortfull), lots of tension, which makes it more difficult to ground/breathe/relax
  * do this constantly while you move; of course an asymptotic goal, never to be reached, always aimed for
* mastery is elegance. moving with as little movements as possible (just 1 curved lines). counting the number of differentiable movements (pathways). moving also with as little effort as possible (minimum is not equals zero); energy-efficiency. having to readjust because of initial misplacement is bad.

spiral "addon" class
----------
* EXERCISE: first stand (later walk around)
  * draw circles with your finger(s); change axis/plane; change direction
  * move axis inside the body and out again
  * walk around and turn while drawing your circles
  * increase complexity: imspiring spiral movements; from arms to: spine/torso, pelvis, knees, ...
  * CONT: slow down, make movements larger
    * draw curves (instead of spirals), almost like lines
  * CONT: find a partner
    * follow their curves as if they are "snail traces in space"
    * then catch up with them (not only follow, but take over), and extend the movement, accelerating their spirals
  * LALA land instruction: add spiral not from arms/body, but from space around (arm pits, etc.)
  * motivates visualization skills, seeing those trails in space; like when a camera with long exposure time, lights being moved
  * sliding on them, projecting/extrapolating them
  * esp. in trio, take from A, and "put into" B
  * tap into the qualities, internalize them "magically" (=without much conscious awareness/thought)
* being slow = sense more, but harder to get momentum
  * beginners need momentum to catch a spiral, speed helps to compensate for hiccups; advanced can also do it slowly
  * spirals are usually making you go faster
    * esp. extended limbs, increase angular momentum/distance from center
* EXERCISE: (already in workshop)
  * lie on back, partner takes head; first just weight, hands on ground; take lots of time, slowly
  * when more than 45 degrees, start to move with (open eyes!)
  * slowly stand up
  * supportive partner enhancing spiral movements, see his pathways
  * one hand on head, other on body
  * 2 phases: 1) give impulses (lead/follow) 2) partner generates spirals himself (self-sufficient/independent)
  * then: join in with your body, manipulate with the box (instead with the hands)
  * great exercise to learn new pathways
  * but: it's an exercise/practice, not "applied CI/dance"
    * not egalitarian, it has a hierarchy, leader/follower; also no sharing weight, not improvised but directed
  * knowledge about anatomy is of use, playing on the edges of possibilities
    * not dislocating a joint, playing safe, but using joints limitations to push into the center
      * head has highest leverage: small push, big impact
* EXERCISE: with partner, 1 crossed arms, other straight arms
  * touching palms (no grabing, ever!)
  * push quite a lot, for support/stability
  * lifting (search for center) with "y-hands", partner needs to bend wrists, push against, to lift up
  * OPTIONAL: 3rd person (=satellite) seeing spirals in space, and suggesting them, helping duette to embody them
    * without touch, just "draw in space", being like a conductor 
    * VARIATION: 3rd person is going to just touch a bit, stroke, draw lines on body to "inject"/extend pathways, giving impulses, actualizing potential spirals
  * don't go on the floor
  * don't over-commit to the hand touch (use as landing gear if needed, don't fall on your nose to maintain hand connection)
  * after a lift, palm-pressure nice to push partner into a spiral
  * satellite is mostly a guardian angel, esp. during lifts; seeing, training eyes
* fun game: after a dance, come up with a movie title fitting the dance, e.g. "kampf der giganten"

* Be aware of the difference between learning/practicing and dancing/applying it. (like in karate: the form/kata when practicing exact, when applying must be different, as adapted to the unique situation; and every execution/situation is different/unique)
  * While we practice, we do it more statically and use (as done in this technique) our hands to push into the partner/floor.
  * During a real dance, we would not use our hands, and instead push from our center/pelvis.
This requires a lot of support (__oomph__) from our base; without it, it won't be possible.
  * Also pay attention to the general rule of adapting technique according to partner differences.
The height difference will dictate whether we push into the body (for shorter people) or into the ground (for taller people, reaching over the base).
* using hands means cheating; sometimes though needed.
  * use hands to push, give leverage support; chicken wings/legs. in any of the 3 levels (floor, lil animal, standing(hip/shoulder))
* don't push, but lean into the ground
  * push: center away, active, negative, effortful (chinese "li")
  * lean: center into (earth/ground), more passive/surrender (spring quality, chinese "jing")
* SPIRALS
  * differentiate initiation: not only fingers VS toes, but also whether FRONT vs BACK
    * moving one side forward, or the other backwards
    * might feel a bit like more about intention than actual movement
  * getting dizzy (or even nauseous):
    * solution is to slow down, to change direction, or to focus on a point (like ballet people are doing)
    * good news: it will get better over time doing it more often you do it, like a muscle
  spirals contain turns in their center
      * a turn is "usually" in one plane only
      * spirals can change/combine multiple planes
      * thus: a spiral can change levels (going up/down) a turn is usually mono-directed (in horizontal plane)
  * speed of turn: linear/static; speed of spiral: accelerated/dynamic
  * EXERCISE bodysurf:
    *  preparation:
      * one partner rolls/spirals on the ground (in lanes), other holds a body part back; forcing the partner to find a new movement/path(way), solving a puzzle
      * e.g. pulling the hand slightly (don't fight, and let partner rotate within the soft grib), torso, knee, elbow, even head
      * partner tries to leave that pulled part back as long as possible and reach with everything else (keeping the spiral "growing" development of movements)
    * sometimes (as flying partner is already more to the front) necessary to slow down for the base, so center stays connected, so partner can catch up; necessary to push into the ground a bit, to "hit the break"
  * EXERCISE: palm-palm pressure, stay connected (can "slide/rotate", they are not glued, but don't grab); some call it "looping"
    * either A) both straight or B) one straight, other crossed
    * through limitation (glueing), we are forced to discover new moves/pathways (creativity); to inspire spirals
* motto floorwork/bodysurf: "your downfall, my rise"
  * use gravitational pull, lock onto it, and use leverage to be moved/lifted
* a beginner's attitude: sliding, jumping, grabing, wanting
* a good teacher:
  * clear instructions, one direction, no back-forth (creates restlessness/confusion in group otherwise)
  * gives clear signals, saying "now start" and "stop", without hesitation; with confidence
  * has a plan, a big one (1-2 hours ahead) and a small one (1-2 minutes ahead)
  * maintains safety, e.g. "removes parking people" from the dancefloor, points out potentially dangerous behavior
  * finds clear words = relies on clarity in ones own mind
    * a fuzzy/unclear mind creates unclear/fuzzy language
  * when participants have questions about what to do, it's usually an indication for a bad teacher
    * same as with follower-leader dances: when follower has a hiccup, it's usually the leader's fault (not being clear)
* "good grab" vs "bad grab"
  * narrow sense: grab with hands, wrap around
    * wider sense: wrap around with any body part, also arms/armpit (even legs); thus chicken-wing/leg is a "soft grab"
    * intention difference: active grab is to manipulate/dominante (but also safeguard/seatbealt), passive grab is to not fall off (safety)
  * with the good: first base offers an invitation/question, then, and only then, when the flyer accepts it, the base can wrap a "safety belt"
  * bad grab: the base takes the flyer, without asking, without any reply, without consent, forcing his intention on the flyer; diminishing his autonomy/agency
  * (good jump/bad jump: finding each other with softness mid-air VS heavy impact)
* advantages/disadvantages of qualities/dimension:
  * e.g. speed: fast/slow...
- right attitude of exercise 1) yang/masculine/external, to succeed in it, achieve, externally appreciated, feeling good, ego, competitive 2) yin/feminine/internal, to challenge, experience, grow, push limits, fail
- two methods of teaching: 1) yang: methodological, technical, precise, practice, analytical/disected, artificial/laboratory, internal aware/stimulus 2) yin: playful, external stimulus, application/doing/implementing, natural/organic
- not about fun/being happy, but satisfication, feeling satisfied. meaning/purpose.
- principle (grammar/abstract concept) vs technique (vocabulary/concrete manifestation)
- order of skills to acquire at the beginning: breathe - relax - balance - ground - share weight - pour weight - rolling contact - lift
- lifts = like cherry on top of a cake, like a spice/salt: don't overdo it, or it will turn bad (respect the break even point)
- my personal teacher's dialect: slow, flowy, oppositional to oldschool CI (dynamic, explosive, risky, survival); deep, more continuous center connection, constant rolling contact
- as advanced dance with beginners (or people with a different CI style/dialect): in order to learn/to grow/break patterns, let yourself be led, don't A) go back in your own comfort zone doing the same you already know and B) don't "enforce it" on the other; but instead follow, listen, be more passive and surrender
- in martial arts "incest" is happening (german: "betriebsblindheit")
  - always working with the same, within the same system; no diversity; it works because both play the game according to the very same rules, with the same principles; no surprise, no challenge, thus no real skill/growth
  - big issue in martial arts, as it is competitive, and once fighting with someone from a different system, it won't work anymore
    - less of an issue in (partner) dance, as it is collaborative (working together, instead against)
    - BUT: narrow experience/skill through narrow exposure, thus not able to deal with "wide range" of what happens, with surprise
- pouring weight
  - obviously possible to do it onto another person, in a duo; shifting my own weight gradually into his
  - but also solo possible: shifting the weight left/right leg
    - have the image of the pelvis being a bowl, pouring water back-forth, slowly
      - don't engage the leg muscles, don't push; but let gravity pull you passively
- general exercise advice:
  - give your partner enough time, much more than you think as an "exercise-conductor"; esp. if you give them verbal commands to be executed
- men are too much, because they are afraid of being "not (good) enough"; women are too little, as they are afraid of "being too much"
  - whether it's taking up space as in talking time, attention, getting needs satisfied, leading (in movement or life; being assertive/dominant), or simply giving weight (men are too heavy and stiff, women are too light and collapsed/lethargic)
- ad movement chapter: developmental patterns, 4 qualities { yield, reach, push, pull }
- EXERCISE with partner:
  - round 1: command to partner to go { up, down }, learn how to relax, surrender
  - round 2: touch a body part and say { up, down } and move from that part
  - round 3: "catch" them mid-air and change direction; or say up a few times, touching different bodyparts
- performance anxiety: wanting to do it well, going faster/higher/stronger
  - BUT: achievement is more measured/judged by amount of sensitivity, an inner quality, unable to be judged/measured from the outside
  - like with weight lifting: not the amount of kilos, but the effort muscle experienced (and what's possible within your daily state, which is always changing); it's sensed, it's a quality, but not a (measurable) quantity; not nice for the ego, for comparison... (fixed vs growth mindset)
  - did you give your best? that's good enough... you failed back and now of course you know it better: did you act based on maximum knowledge available (besten wissen und gewissen), did you try your best? then you succeeded, because everything else is out of your control, you are not god.
- EXERCISE: in trios, designated "main focus partner"
  - pouring weight exercise for going up/down: partnered squad with back2back (breathe, look, move)
  - round 1: stand in front of each other, "appropriate" distance, arms away front, palms facing to partner; fall forward, pour weight, catch-stretch; other 2 switch each time; relax the joints
  - round 2: when contact, roll to one side (communicate it non-verbally), push into
  - round 3: include going down/up; advanced: use single/tiny/small point of contact for going down/up; maybe switch/move/roll while going down/up
* ultimate goal is "elegance". minimum effort. minimum adjustments necessary afterwards, cheat, incorrect/imprecise placements.
* not-wanting theory:
  * buddhism: is saying "don't attach" (to an idea/thing), i'd say they are wrong, like christianity denying the worldly, the pleasures, the deep joy (with it's potentially deep suffering)
  * zen: is saying "be able to detach again"; story with the monk walking, given a porsche for free (buddhists/christian would say no), he drives, car has full accident (capitalist would feel bad, unable to detach), he walks again without any worry
  * in CI: it's ok to have a plan (what to do next) BUT be able to let go of it if the moment requires (if it's not possible); the window of opportunity is usually rather short, so have to act in the moment, as with every tick of thinking about it how/what to do, time runs out and the window closes again
    * don't force it, as it creates a disconnect, a bump
  * daoism: observe and adapt to the flow of nature (nature in sense of spinoza, not the romantic green stuff, nothing esoteric, but universe, natural laws, like physics, the inherent order of things given by itself)
* social aspect of walking exercise:
  * daring wo evades first (courage competition like two cars at collision course); bit of a power-hierarchy-play; for men, not so much for women
  * we seek close proximity to those we like/are curious about; we keep distance to the others
  * we say hello by getting close; get too close too quickly and you will scare those cats off and away; be sensitive!
* more professional dancers are good in being light/fast/lots of decoration/show off performance
  * they lack substance/depth: sensitivity/grounding/slowness/center-connection
* beginner's question: how to know whether my partner wants to be lifted?
  * slow down, listen, be sensitive, read/interpret signals; or simply ask (afterwards)
    * watch more subtle cues: muscle tonus, breath (joy or fear?)
  * trust the other's ability to send clear signals, saying yes/no non-verbally
    * learn to say yes/no as a flyer yourself, giving clear signals
    * such as: making yourself heavy/light, grounding/flying, going down/up, moving center down/up, contracting/expanding
* beginner's mistake: no support structure, butterfly touch only, no oomph-center-sharing-weight
  * very effortful, as no structure to rely on (with each other), not building an architecture, not working together but separately
  * why could that be? fear of giving weight ("am i too heavy/a burden")? of intimacy? (esp. women) lack stability within themselves? sense of balance? unable to rearrange their feet/structure to find stability? trust in their capability to take weight? projecting own inability to say no onto others, thus not daring to give themselves?
* ad motto: shu-ha-ri
  * shu: follow rule, beginner: 0-5 years; you don't know anything, and you know that; you are supposed to blindly follow your master, as you won't understand anyway the why; trust, have endurance
  * ha: break rule, intermediate: 5-15 years; the longest phase, testing your own skills, dangerous, usually over-estimation; bit of understanding of the reasons behind the rules; occasionally breaking them with high risk (injury)
  * ri: become rule, master: 15+ years; deep experiencial embodiment of all the rules and principles; many accidents/injuries; he can do the forbidden stuff/black magic, knowing that in this specific case the consequences are minimal/non-existing
  * watch out for dunning kruger effect; most intermediate overestimate themselves
    * there are no shortcuts, you have to go through the long and hard work which comes with the intermediate state, and not jump directly to the master state; ego-arrogance, eagerness, impatience.
  * ad motto: "you can do whatever you want, as long as you know what you're doing"
  * understand the rule, then you can find deliberate choice to "defuse" them
* good jump: no impact (landing) on the partner, but used for momentum (turning, twisting) while the pressure on the partner stays constant; a connected movement, together, instead of a disconnected one (no listening possible, no moving along together thus no impact)
* ad motto: aurelius: "life's a wrestle, not a dance"
* ad jargon: butterfly touch
* on the floor, to move "like a lava lamp"
- social / how to find a partner: first (way before), 1) know yourself (quality movement, energy levels; slow/fast paced) 2) what are you looking for (someone compatible or be inspired by someone different) and then 3) look on dancefloor for something fitting
  - 2 kind of partners: 1) enjoyable (that hot chick, not much to learn there) or 2) learning/growth (old stinky fat man); depending on how much you can take in that moment, (deliberately) choose one or the other
  - next step: don't eye-gaze, dance in negative space; be receptive whether welcome or not (tension, breathing, looking, moving away/into)
- lots to learn by observing people dancing by themselves; groundedness, speed

* motto, mastery. "Creative thought without guided practice—structured repetition—leads to great ideas with poor execution." -- stan goldberg
  * repetition is the path to mastery
  * boring, but necessary to achieve
  * first slow, perfection. then only increase speed
  * if you dont use it, you lose it
  * making it automatic, like walking. we also had to learn that once.
  * in our today's western society considered as boring. no commitment, everything needs to be fun/pleasurable (hedonistic?), no hard work, no dedication; only superficial, no depth.
  * making it into an automatism.
  * musicians, 8 hours a day, scales, for decades
  * sword fighters, 5000 cuts a day, every day, for decades
  * any world champion, in sports or whatever: repetition is the key
  * especially repetition of the basics. over and over again. yet, with quality (not only focus on quantity). don't practice imperfection. not speed either, but with focused attention.
* mushin quality, not doing, not forcing 
  * realizing potential
  * sword fighting story: me cutting, not working. teacher cutting, two times, once mid-air. you want, you will not go straight. you let it happen, with a quick impulse at the beginning, and let the sword do its thing, through momentum and gravity, it will all go well, trust.
    * add picture of karlheinz cutting, when telling the story
  * when the window of possibility opens, to take it. when it's too late, and it closes again, don't rush it or break it open.
  * a thin line betwen forcing and realizing potential.
* a thin line between dominating (forcing my will upon you) and leading (offering, suggesting, support)
* waves (in comparison to spirals)
  * in all 3 different planes; combine them in sequence and parallel
  * also arm movements, spiral from shoulder VS from fingers
  * turned waves are VERY similar to spirals... open investigation
* rolling point of contact (rpoc), also on the ground. smoothing rolling, no edges, no (sudden) bumps, no sounds. curves, round. maintaining momentum/trajectory, pathway. beginners bump, with partner and with ground, but on ground more magnified/visible.
* ad safety culture: try not to smell like "doener kebap", it's just not nice for your partners; meaning: after cooking, bring fresh clothes
* dancing with with someone doing something awkward, something you don't like, how to deal with it?
  * e.g. beginners often break the pathway, most of the time just not aware of it (not necessarily lack of skills, or maybe that as well)
    * pathway breaks, unexpected sudden changes, giving me a shock into my nervous system, very unenjoyable
      * reason probably: many people, especially women, most likely avoid rolling over the front
  * what to do about it?
    * 1. try to push (force) it a bit
    * 2. imitate/mirror your partner, so she hopefully gets aware what she is doing by experiencing it herself (non-teaching teaching, an indirect approach)
    * 3. simply talk, say it, direct approach; after other alternatives failed; what am i observing, what do i need, what can we do about it to improve it; are you ok with it?
    * 4. "if you can't beat them, join them"
      * change it from an "incompatible ingredient" to the main dish; making it an exercise, create one yourself; adapt to the situation what is
        * lemon => lemon juice; omdenken; suffering due to conflict with reality
      * how to enjoy breaking pathways? how to dance with the limitation of only back touching?
    * 5. extreme case: leave it.
  * when level of intimacy doesn't feel ok => learn to set your boundaries without lowering the experience of the dance; stay connected within your comfort zone
    * e.g. using "ballet arms", like a balloon when rolling over the front; or slide over the belly
* the use of sounds; evolutionary: a scream = a warning; communication
  * also: an expression of joy (weeeeeee)
  * often deliberately used for tension release (sounding = exhale)
* "skill is measured by principle (basics/foundation) adherence , not shiny/cool lifts (with lacking any principle adherence)"
* grounding mistake: over-tensing, stiff legs, partner will feel lots of little impacts in his body-system, "hard steps"
  * be strong yet soft (chinese: jing > li)
* flow VS speed
  * flow: principles, basics, quality, deep, profound, subtleties
  * speed: techniques, superficial, easily impressive, shiny, simple entertainment
* EXERCISE: rolling inner point of contact
  * A) standing, partner touches 2 points, you have to connect them
  * B) then from standing to moving/dancing, partner says "pause" and gives points
  * easy: many joints in between
  * difficult (even only intention): both points on 1 (long) bone
    * impossible ones: neck, arm/knee pit
  * feel free to use spirals, to go around, instead of direct lines
  * be precise, be slow!
* EXERCISE: floor point of contact
  * basically the same as before, but now draw a line (like painting) on the ground
  * don't jump points, one continuous line, be precise; have your partner point out hiccups
* EXERCISE: Box RPoC
  * 1) back2back, drawing a square on each other's backs
    * be slow and precise; don't jump points, buldge out a lot
    * esp. during shoulder bladed and lower back
  * 2) draw an X instead (with upper/lower line going horizontally)
    * have 3rd person give corrections and say "reverse" every now and then
    * pay attention to be synchronized when moving; be at the same point at the same time (speed sync; listening required)
* quotes from: William Arthur Ward 
* RPoC (rolling point of contact)
  * do it with the ground, with your feet, having "smart feet", soft rolling down, on the balls/front first (not heel)
    * e.g. jump and land without a sound
    * e.g. when going down from a lift, land first toes
  * think of how cars were built: 50 years ago very rigid; today very soft
    * creating more time to slow down to zero, taking away kinetic energy (lowering the impact) and transfer it into the deformation process
    * this change in thinking (safety through rigidity) has saved unbelievable many lives since then
  * RPoC requires wave patterns; bulging out
    * to land softly with feet, "going down in a wave"
  * as a base, to enable flyer to land softly
    * 1) go down, lowering your center, bending knees
    * 2) create a diagonal ramp, tilt the pelvis/torso sideways to slide him down
    * 3) stay in contact once flyer touches the ground; don't disappear too quickly; give lots of oomph/support, push into him so they can slowly+softly transition/shift weight
    * in general: slow down, give much oomph, be controlled and sensitive/listening
    * maybe even push up, e.g. support the flyer's leg by pulling it up slightly (watch out to not bring him in risky situation by grabbing his landing gear)
      * push up against gravitational pull, "making him light"
* a good partner anticipates your future positions, and will be there where needed
  * he has a 3D internal mental model (not needed to see; no visual connection needed)
  * be there to support, "save his ass"
  * how? extend arms, reach with wings; also push into, very strong
  * this enables to build trust, through safety; can i rely on you; allowing to go "higher" (more risky moves)
    * enables you to slighlty go over your limits, as your partner will (hopefully) compensate for your "going over your limits" 
* body awareness: a mental activity; the spotlight shining; it's about the source of the light, not its target surface
  * what people mean: unnecessary chatter of the mind; irrelevant topics being chewed on; being distract, lack of ability to focus
* ad spiral: drawing of..
  * 2D spiral: start from point in center, go in circles constant increase of distance r (similar yet different then concentric circles)
  * 3D spiral: doing same, but constantly increasing z axis: going up, still r increases; looking from the side, it's like a triangle (tornado) growing
  * 2D helix: basical a circle, not much happening
  * 3D helix: a spring; looking from side looks like a rectangle, as r stays constant (not increasing)
* ad anatomy: feet vs foot; stomach vs belly

  * "When we engage in rotational movements, our body creates a spiral-like chain reaction that extends from our feet all the way up to our head."
