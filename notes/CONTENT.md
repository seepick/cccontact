* insights from my workshop (raul's class end november)
  * based on the questions from beginners
    * without grounding there is nothing, no foundation, nothing to build upon
    * breathing, breathing, breathing -a constant reminder, useful
    * general: what is CI (compared to others)? what is its history?
    * why not grab the hands? (it feels more safe)
    * why do we depersonalize the dance partner? isn't it devaluing?
    * ad tantric distance: does it mean the partner is constantly in our bed?!
    * WHY? do we do this exercise, how is it relevant during the dance?
    * soft skills: social (start/end/join a dance), boundary/consent is important!
  * based on what i observed them having difficulties
    * instead of floating, making themselves light, people tend to be a heavy iron ball
    * there is an eagerness (adrenalin, excitement) which can be dangerous; or simply destroying the beauty of an "it's just happening" experience (jumping instead of pouring weight)
    * counter-acting your inner doubts, blocking your success: use positive affirmation, it is easy, you are light (some of us feel too heavy, a burden...)
  * how i can expand in the "teaching" chapter. a good teacher ...
    * will allow you to explore/research by yourself; time wise, but also open that you do it slightly differently; there is no right/wrong but differences in goals/context/approaches
    * will invest enough time for the psychological/personal, the bonding of the group into a community to create a safe space (sharings, etc)
    * acknowledges his limits in practical ability and knowledge; he will admit and own it with confidence; being realistic, down to earth, humble
* a full 2hrs class (exercises):
  * solo sit, shift weight from butt-cheek to other; hand on ground, scissor legs, feet ALWAYS stay on the ground; when turning right, left leg goes first (also extend with left arm; reach long)
  * ... MAXIMUM RELAXATION/SOFTNESS ...
  * do the same lying down, relax the head
  * do full turns now; basically a shrimp+starfish movement
  * do full turns + in little animal up; do it in lanes, both sides (L/R; facing head opposite directions)
  * find partner...
  * first on same spot in room (pre-exercise): little animal positions; inner leg first over on belly, same side hand (as leg over) moves, spiral on the back legs first onto the partner
  * in lanes: both roll (like done before), one goes in little animal, other follow and over (as before)
  * pre-exercise: do the 90 degrees starfish exercise/turn solo on the spot (with teacher-partner)
  * traditional bodysurf
    * WATCH OUT to always cross/be perpendicular, and not parallel (otherwise too much weight on the partner; also risk to put weight on knees/head); either arms or legs, but never both go over at the same time 
  * "pick-up: partner exercise:
    * base is rolling "against" (into/towards) the partner with belly or back; then "releases", so flyer is "falling"/"drops" into partner
    * surfer/flyer relaxes head back, articulates spine, let legs softly follow by themselves
    * don't jump! avoid quick, sharp moves as they are potentially dangerous/risky
  * free dance (explore, integrate); sharing
  * partner A rolling towards B, B putting knee under the "belt area" (belly/lower back); timing is relevant; A rolling over
    * IMPORTANT: keep centers connected! (use chicken legs)
    * then other partner offers "surface below"
    * stay SLOW&CONTROLLED, RELAXED&SOFT
  * continuation: "pick up" technique again, and immediately move "support under" (combining both skills)
    * possibly B helps a bit by using his hand to pull A's center a bit
  * CLASSICAL HIP LIFT:
    * begin with hand sliding diagonally over front of partner
      * it's like "picking up" technique on the floor: taking initiative for a lift as the base, not waiting for the flyer to initiate)
    * get sure to offer enough "side ramps", for going on/off
  * AD LIFTS: get sure when going down, one has to change direction (usually/easier for the base)
* when dancing in negative space with partner, don't only sense the center, but (for more advanced people) sense also their breath
* when moving from head (actually even better from the eyes), the spine becomes more agile.
  * when being lifted landing on the back (not belly), then for sure lead from the head; super advanced, super scary, and super fun (those spirals, everything upside down)
* when flying, reaching/superman OR relax/hang?
  * both can have their own pros/cons
  * reach: usually preferred, more active/engaged. lighter. easier to spiral and move.
  * relax: feels like heavy rice bag (grounding; vs levithian); being soft is more adaptable though, flexible, ready to embrace the moment, what's happening, surprise, improvisation
  * challenge then maybe: best of both worlds, to be active, yet open for surprises.
* eyes closed VS eyes open... why (not). when. TODO.
* the difference between a "good jump" and a "bad jump"
  * it's mostly about timing. that we find each other softly mid-air, and no bump/clash landing.
  * not for beginners, maybe not for intermediate (unsafe, lack of skill, too quick), advanced with care.
  * be humble when doing it. regulate your enthusiasm/adrenaline to stay in a safe zone.
  * always know where your partner is: does he have the constitution/strength and skill to lift you? don't surprise. have danced with him already. and don't do it out of surprise but super announced.
* ad FEEDBACK:
  * feedback is pure data, without judgment (neutral). like a thermostat.
    * see in soccer, when a kid is playing by itself. it doesn't need a coach, because he gets immediate feedback by seeing whether the ball is in or not. also if not, which direction its too far, and can adjust. learning made easy.
    * just reflect objective facts, but avoid interpreting anything.
    * it might be within or not the given exercise.
  * when saying "you did good/bad" we focus on the relational/psychological aspect, which disturbs the learning process. there is an emotional part, which is bigger the closer the person is to us. "where there is light, there is shadow": when we say its good, and the next time we don't say it, it might be considered bad.
* a beginner's attitude, a researcher's mindset: nothing right/wrong, just different. know the difference, ask/question, experience yourself by trying all alternatives. then, by knowing the context/circumstance, you can choose the most appropriate solution.
  * as a total beginner, you might wanna blindly follow though, as you are missing the basic tools to research yourself and understand deeper mechanics.
* EXERCISE: stand, close eyes; with palm, very quickly go down, and stop very quickly and try to hover 1cm above the ground.

what makes a good dance? (INTERVIEW with pau)
======================================================================================================================
* title:
  * a good CI-practitioner a good CI-practitioner?
  * an enjoyable/pleasant/satisfiable CI interaction?
  * what are the skills of an experienced contacter?
* personal VS technical: of course, technical can be compensated by personal; e.g. XYZ i don't like, but because i like her, XYZ doesn't bother me
* many things are not set in stone/absolute rules; people are different (generally and also in the moment/situation), the relations with people are different (good friend vs. stranger)
  * follow gut-feeling, intuition; observe carefully (upfront; body language, posture)
  * the skill of feeling the boundaries of the other
* takes time to make initial contact: from space in the room, to negative space, to contact
  * having made himself noticeable upfront; eye contact, smile, smalltalk... (bit trust/familiarity)
  * reading people in the space (before the class, warm up; how they walk)
  * starting already further away, how much time to reach closer in personal space
    * if rushed, feels aggressive; if too slow, feels insecure and strange (odd; unsafe; unnatural... edgy)
    * eye contact? maybe too invasive; for beginners sometimes necessary maybe (plus smiling); too long/staring definitely bad
      * similar with approach too frontal (confrontational); from behind also bad; when safety necessary: my back to hers
      * maybe diagonal (not from front/back), with my side directing to her (not my front)
      * e.g. approaching and making contact someone from behind; risky, but with some even ok, and they like it. for others a shock, trauma invoking.
  * receptive to consider signals received when approaching (reacting to them)
    * when i retreat, he retreats, or at least stays; my boundaries are being respected (image of a cautious cat)
    * mirroring (not necessarily mirror/imitate, but influenced by it), acknowledging each other (not being ignored), creating sympathy
  * adjusting/attune to each other's quality (grammar/language/dialect), finding common space/speed/quality; be on same wavelength
    * the slowest/lowest dictates the speed/skill; faster adjusts to slower; high-skilled adjusts to low-skilled (slowest walk at the front of the group)
    * don't just throw people in the air (acrobatics, grabbing, no autonomy, without an accepted invitation)
      * some people seem to be restless (it's in their personality); doing/wanting/acting; forced and too fast => know and express your boundaries
  * in general, touch first with back (upper body back), back2back, or sides (shoulder), or back-side of arm/hand (not palm)
* slow... slow in approach in room/negative space; slow when touching; maybe even stand still; breath a moment
  * motto: "it can almost never be too slow, it can always be too fast though"
  * to feel we need to go slow, to go deep we need to go even slower (like in tantra/sexuality; take time to feel boundary, what's ok; time to feel and take decisions)
  * once we know each other, found/met each other (can be also very quick; with presence and sensitivity; flow established), we can go faster and faster, and the sky is the limit
    * has my partner the principles (grounding/sharing weight, rolling point of contact, pathway continuation) embodied? (CI specific experience/skill)
      * the skill of checking/testing your partner as quickly as possible
* motto: "when in doubt, always play it safe" (when in doubt, it's a no)
* during the dance:
  * pure technique not so much important...
    * even a CI-beginner without any specific techniques, but with general body skill (embodiment, awareness, precision, strength, balance) can be super nice
      * "hard body skill"/masculine: technical skill, strength, speed, courage (risk-wanting)
      * "soft body skills"/feminine (embodiment): awareness, sensitivity, softness, listening (feeling for one's body; segmentation, precision); afraid/risk-averse 
    * general body skill > CI skill (principles) > CI techniques (lifts)
  * relaxation in the body, yet firm/grounded ("soft yet strong"); breathing
    * trust necessary to relax, to ground; lack of trust, fear (wanting to control; holding); intention (meta level) of how we use muscle strength (gespannt aber nicht verspannt); closed muscles
  * creativity:
    * the "wow" effect, when "it" happens, without me/you/us doing it. improvisation, surprise (ourselves/each other; surrender to the moment/trust), when things emerge and letting go of doing something new. breaking patterns. together. "unvorhergesehenes"
      * e.g. ask 2 people to draw something together on a single sheet of paper; without them knowing what they intended
      * e.g. improvisation acting, when both say one word, how the story gets created
    * not staying too much/too strictly with CI technical paradigm/dogma; working with what is 
  * trust, predictability (without too much forced control)
  * the mysterious oomph quality; support, sharing weight, ...


* rolling "point" of contact
  * can also be multiple ones, points
  * can also be a surface area
  * yet, usually try to be "pointy", by bugling out, a clearer communication established
  * more than 2 points: several information streams at the same time, very advanced; keeping track of them
* a proper "exercise attitude"
  * active research is different than "simply dancing/enjoying", simply applying it (application), having fun/pleasure
  * it makes the dance "bumpy", less good, less pleasant; it's meant to be!
  * this is where growth happens, outside th eknown/the habits/the comfort-zone; into the learning zone
  * less pleasing also for the partner; don't be afraid to do mistakes (ego; self-worth); less showing off
* in partner exercises, think for your partner
  * the signal you send, the specific challenge you choose (which body part, which command)
  * being a good exercise partner by being aware on a meta-level; to think ahead, and know what and why you are doing
  * "foerdern durch fordern"; to support by challenge; stay in proximal development area (in learning zone; not comfort, not panic zone)
* "in my head"
  * what it means: to have distracting thoughts, unproductive, irrelevant here
  * yet, don't confuse with focused attention; being present, with "heart and brain", with "body and head"; united
  * if growth is relevant, then it is effortful
  * stages
    * as a beginner: just fun, effortless, chaotic
    * intermediate: hard effortfull work, precise, controlled
    * advanced: effortless, precise and controleld, or chaotic if choses to (knowing the risks)
    * like driving a car: as a child, pretend to drive, super fun, without effort, talking while doing; then doing hard work of exam for a driver license, having to practice and study theoretically, stress in traffic; and now as an adult again enjoying driving without even thinking about it, effortless, on auto pilot, as in "how did i get home?"
* when advanced look for beginners to dance with; something that happens often in the (professional) dance community:
  * they want to get inspired, breaking their habits/patterns; beginners are not yet too "biased" (betriebsblind); otherwise usually "incest" (like in martial arts)
  * to get back to the more (relevant) basic principles; they are bored by the hoopedipoop-techniques (lifts)
* language metaphor:
  * beginners don't talk the language yet, still they try to say "something", so they just say random things; sometimes they are lucky, and say something of meaning, yet not knowing what the meaning of it is; an accident; something that will lead to a surprise
  * when I speak french, but you speak spanish, after some time of not being successful understanding each other, we simply switch back to the common denominator: gibberish. only (simple) tone/melody, making sounds (movement), but no (exclusive) words/grammar (lifts)
* "going fast is easy, going slow is difficult"
  * fast, mistakes can easily by covered up/masked; being off balance
  * slow, needs way more control
  * slow is everything zoomed in; the small hickups will be huge/visible
  * our fast mentality, expressed through movement
  * when you can do it slowly, you can do it fast
* "you see, you know immediately, whether someone got skill or not; you see their personality expressed; the flow, the talents... try to make it explicit. what is it precisely that makes them so? enumerate criteria"
* sensitivity (=the ability to listen) requires gentleness/softness. softness is minimum effort/tensions, min. engagement of muscle fibres
  * a higher-resolution of neuro-muscular connection. precision: 82% vs 82.3% of activation (tension). like kink-spanking: being able to hit with 40% vs 45%, to slowly expand the comfort zone. otherwise: danger, risk of injury, going too fast, breaking boundary, breaking a person, or at least a bone.
* too much wanting, forcing it. not enough openness, improvisation; being and listening what the moment want to unfold, letting yourself be surprised without anticipation.
* beginner's mistakes: // always describe what is wrong (observable facts), why it is wrong (dangers, inefficiencies) and tell what's better instead (what&why) AND: "nothing wrong, as long as know what you are doing"
  * off-balance, leaning (not sharing weight); like a plank, a diagonal shape; instead of bending knees and hips, and have upper body upright sharing into the shared center of mass.
  * lifts are often a matter of grabbing, with mere muscular force; instead of passively invite, moving the center underneath
* closing your yes is very much different; more perception, sensory capacity shifts from visual to tactile (like blind people hear more)
  * now try to move your head: losing sense of orientation (where's up/down), play with it (if you dare)
* motto: "limitation gives freedom"
  * sparkles creativity due to a necessity
  * total freedom is something we actually don't want, although we might scream for it; we humans like to have boundaries, to be kept safe in a cage
