Edition 2
====================================================================================================

* go through TODO-BACKLOG.md / sort it a bit
  * differentiate between A) can be immediately put into document, and B) task notes which require summary/additional work before it can be used


* rework glossary: scan whole document for (fancy) terms; rework existing ones (descriptions; capital casing??)
* roter faden; book's ultimate goal:
    * watch out that it doesn't get too big (split afterward; maybe beginner VS experienced); less is more (30-100 pages)
    * for beginners (not profi/experienced); total noobs
* !!! incorporate feedback v1; review the whole book again
