Edition 2
====================================================================================================

NEW CHAPTER STRUCTURE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* => see pages DOC
* new chapters social & mastery (draw new images)
* put chapter "motto" into "principles"
* => rename from "techniques" to "technical"
* maybe rename "anatomy" to "biology"? or... "human sciences" and physics to "physical sciences"
* maybe merge "jargon" into "techniques"?
* ?? change all chapter titles: "principles - the inner workings of it all", "history - how it all started", ... (?)

ROADMAP
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* brainstorm my view/definitions on dance
* => current RESOURCE working on: https://contactquarterly.com/contact-improvisation/about/index.php
* interview: feldenkrais-ariane approach (movement qualities; breathing; spiral movements)
* more quotes from: William Arthur Ward
* 2 phased ToC: first just sections; and after it again but with deeper levels
* rework glossary: scan whole document for (fancy) terms; rework existing ones (descriptions; capital casing??)
* book martin keogh
* ... websites / videos ...

RESTYLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* !!! incorporate feedback v1; review the whole book again
* when declaring as something bad/wrong, always also add why, AND what's good instead, how to do it better

DRAWINGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
FREEd drawings to us:
* definition.png two salsa people dancing; use it for "comparison to dance"
* history.png paxton&stark ... use it still in history / founding parents
* motivation.png
* mottos.png

TODOs:
* maybe need to redraw some chapter images (improve or totally replace)
* movement, explanations
* explanatory symbols (little people, roughly drawn, with arrows indicating directions, etc.)
* vectors, for push/pull/yield... 2 objects
* spirals ..
  * 2D spiral: start from point in center, go in circles constant increase of distance r (similar yet different then concentric circles)
  * 3D spiral: doing same, but constantly increasing z axis: going up, still r increases; looking from the side, it's like a triangle (tornado) growing
  * 2D helix: basical a circle, not much happening
  * 3D helix: a spring; looking from side looks like a rectangle, as r stays constant (not increasing)
