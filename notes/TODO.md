TO*DO list
====================================================================================================

SMALLer TODOs
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* roter faden; book's ultimate goal:
  * watch out that it doesn't get too big (split afterward; maybe beginner VS experienced); less is more (30-100 pages)
  * for beginners (not profi/experienced); total noobs
* bring more personal stories (anecdotes), make it relatable/personal. what happened in toms classes, martial arts, other dance classes (any movement or non-movement related), etc... inspire/motivate (like chen yinchung back then) 
* !!! incorporate feedback v1; review the whole book again
* rework glossary: scan whole document for (fancy) terms; rework existing ones (descriptions; capital casing??)
* find more inspiring quotes

IDEAS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* incorporate Movement Notation document (kinesiology, etc.)
* add waaaay more sketches with explanatory symbols (little people, roughly drawn, with arrows indicating directions, etc.)
* => generally comment for book: be balanced in judgments, shine light to cons AND PROs! e.g. when talking about flow/fun/feel/...
  * at the end, explicitly then state my personal opinion (like kurzgesagt does)
* fun chapter about "CI archetypes" (list pros and cons of each of them)
  * e.g. the ecstatic dance hippie (overly wobbly, smells funny and fancy clothes), the acrobat (fast, technical, dangerous), the dancer (very accentuated, more decoration than substance), the sexy hunter (male or female; little clothes, overly sensual), the rock (insensitive muscle guy lifting everyone, especially small women)
* @tom: can you give me all your CI videos? :)
* latex templates: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tagged/book
* ask that blonde lady, which interviewed me once; whether i can get her notes please (from all she interviewed).
* research "muscle memory"

LATER
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* draw more illustrations (movement, explanations; not only cover images)
* add more drawings of vectors (for push/pull/yield... 2 objects)
* developmental pattern
