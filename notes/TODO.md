Edition 2
====================================================================================================

ROADMAP
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* WIP - interview paris
  * [.][ ][ ] pt1: written answers / transcript / into content
  * [ ][ ][ ] pt2: written answers / transcript / into content
  * [ ][ ][ ] pt3: written answers / transcript / into content
* WIP book martin keogh
* WIP book cheryl pallant
* rename "anatomy" to "human" (anatomy, physilogy, medicine; muscle theory; injuries; vestibular, proprioception), and "physics" to "nature" (physics: gravity, kinetic force, angular momentum)
* ad about: most books are rather poetic; for me, not much content/meaning; aesthetical maybe pleasing for some, like starring at an abstract art painting, but for me less of value; i want to provide tangible, down-to-earth, clear knowledge, immediately applicable in your next session
* rename "technical" to "skills"
* fix chapter images; incorporate unused ones
* story telling: think of 7 personal stories to include
  * aikido teacher, retreat, cutting (300 VS 5000)
  * paris taijiquan....
  * wing chun...
  * ...
* create overview of all chapters and roughly their content (maybe draw it on paper and stick on wall)
* brainstorm my view/definitions on dance
* => current RESOURCE working on: https://contactquarterly.com/contact-improvisation/about/index.php
* interview: feldenkrais-ariane approach (movement qualities; breathing; spiral movements)
* more quotes from: William Arthur Ward
* 2 phased ToC: first just sections; and after it again but with deeper levels
* rework glossary: scan whole document for (fancy) terms; rework existing ones (descriptions; capital casing??)
* ... websites / videos ...
* use term "Contacters"
* add pictures; 1) think of which could be nice 2) prepare people/photographer/scripr 3) go to zaal 100 (rent the room?) and execute 4) post edit
* youtube [timeboxed] some CI videos
* rename "dancers" to "practictioners"; rename "share a dance" to "move with" (?)
* ad movement chapter: developmental movement patterns, release technique, and floorwork

RESTYLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* !!! incorporate feedback v1; review the whole book again
* when declaring as something bad/wrong, always also add why, AND what's good instead, how to do it better
* use the word "contacter"

DRAWINGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
FREEd drawings to us:
* definition.png two salsa people dancing; use it for "comparison to dance"
* history.png paxton&stark ... use it still in history / founding parents
* motivation.png
* mottos.png

TODOs:
* maybe need to redraw some chapter images (improve or totally replace)
* movement, explanations
* explanatory symbols (little people, roughly drawn, with arrows indicating directions, etc.)
* vectors, for push/pull/yield... 2 objects
* spirals ..
  * 2D spiral: start from point in center, go in circles constant increase of distance r (similar yet different then concentric circles)
  * 3D spiral: doing same, but constantly increasing z axis: going up, still r increases; looking from the side, it's like a triangle (tornado) growing
  * 2D helix: basical a circle, not much happening
  * 3D helix: a spring; looking from side looks like a rectangle, as r stays constant (not increasing)


BACKLOG
====================================================================================================
* ? appendix in ToC? (glossary, list of figures)
* harvest CI Zagreb workshop GDoc for exercises
* make a video-presentation "history of CI", just like gert did about zouk
* send interview questions to CI teachers worldwide
* incorporate articles from CI quarterly
* improve wiki resources:
  * add pictures of videos/books (covers)
  * go through CQ's ones: https://contactquarterly.com/contact-editions/index.php#category=contact-improvisation
* make appendix documents:
  * taijiquan grounding (paris interview), movement notation, human (anatomy, physilogy, medicine; muscle theory; injuries; vestibular, proprioception), nature (physics: gravity, kinetic force, angular momentum)
