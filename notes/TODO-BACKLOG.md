IDEAS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* bring more personal stories (anecdotes), make it relatable/personal. what happened in toms classes, martial arts, other dance classes (any movement or non-movement related), etc... inspire/motivate (like chen yinchung back then)
* CAVE: remarks about feel/think, being in head while dancing; give empathy, be less attacking; provide solutions, tools, help to resolve it; be easy on yourself, make peace
* add https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziran
* ad anatomy: the "core" is not only the abs (4 abdominal layers of muscles), way more: all the muscles that are connected to the spine! so also the back, upper legs, etc...
* ad physics: 3-body problem; a swing; chaos, unpredictable (like the weather); with 2, it's possible to predict, like 0.5secs before, easy, safe, even risky stuff is safe; but with 3 (a trio) it becomes impossible
* when talking about spirals, add a lot of drawings. e.g. spherical spiral, cyclindric siral; vortex; spiral/helix from top and side
* also address isue of men bein goverly sexual (a dating place?); human urges, unwanted behaviors; also women's inability to express (feel/know?) boundaries (freeze)
* interview: ariane, feldenkrais approach (movement qualities; breathing; spiral movements)
* research term "homologous"
* incorporate Movement Notation document (kinesiology, etc.)
* add waaaay more sketches with explanatory symbols (little people, roughly drawn, with arrows indicating directions, etc.)
* => generally comment for book: be balanced in judgments, shine light to cons AND PROs! e.g. when talking about flow/fun/feel/...
    * at the end, explicitly then state my personal opinion (like kurzgesagt does)
* fun chapter about "CI archetypes" (list pros and cons of each of them)
    * e.g. the ecstatic dance hippie (overly wobbly, smells funny and fancy clothes), the acrobat (fast, technical, dangerous), the dancer (very accentuated, more decoration than substance), the sexy hunter (male or female; little clothes, overly sensual), the rock (insensitive muscle guy lifting everyone, especially small women)
* @tom: can you give me all your CI videos? :)
* latex templates: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tagged/book
* ask that blonde lady, which interviewed me once; whether i can get her notes please (from all she interviewed).
* research "muscle memory"

LATER
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* complementary disciplines/styles to CI:
    * for deep body awareness feldenkrais
    * for strength, control and precision pilates
    * for floorwork/handstand some movement/animal flow/locomotion classes (at “movement amsterdam”, or “crazy monkey”)
    * for flow and integrated, soft yet controlled bodymovemeents gaga and contemporary improvisation
    * partner acrobatics for the fancy stuff (dangerous!)
    * aikido, jujitsu, judo, ... for rolling and practical understanding of anatomy/bio-mechanics (joints)
* draw more illustrations (movement, explanations; not only cover images)
* add more drawings of vectors (for push/pull/yield... 2 objects)
* developmental pattern
