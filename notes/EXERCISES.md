* ad level of contact/depth
  * from osteopathy: hand onlying partner, take loooots of time, going through layers: fabrics clothes, hair, skin, fat, blood vessels, fascia, muscles, fascia, bones... and all the way back again.
  * dance and have different levels with different body parts; be super conscious about it
    * easily tempted to use sliding contact with skin touch; try to stay with rolling point
  * trio, 1 in middle, 2 other adapt to depth level (qualities of contact) of one in the
* from knee sitting, other partner is standing on the side, pelvis&shoulders connect; from knee sitting into little animal, other partner goes with (sharing weight, yet sliding point of contact); and then A) fingers pointing away (easier) or B) towards the partner (more difficult). roll over partner, maybe with a small kick, make sure center-on-center (balanced; have a pause, break, verify you are stable, thus having all the options available again). go down on same or other side. stay in contact! don't lose oomph quality! for the base: you move, lower, support, push where needed.
* bodysurf: start sitting back2back; legs bent (can push). one partner reaches stretched arms up and to one side, going onto his belly. other partner goes over, from other side, with his back on the lying partner (stay on the back, no spiral, otherwise no continuation easily possible; in this exercise). important: base is chicken-wing hooking the upper partner to ensure the centers are connected; also helps with the flyer, when he "drops", to use this as leverage to get up, ending into seated position again.
* sit side2side, both spread legs; one partner rolls over between other's legs, reaching arm between first; then is upside down (weird/funny position, butt towards other's chest). stay very close to center (don't put weight on legs, painful); stay slow & controlled. sitting partner helps rolling partner with arms to roll over. also possible with 3 people (2 people back2back and 1 "roller")
* rolls: alone, animal, standing
  * 1) aikido roll; in lanes on the ground
  * 2) on little animal (continuous, like did with yvette): in trios, guardian angel, saying "over" or "under"
  * 3) standing: more difficult&dangerous, only for advanced
* start back2back, going down and up via squad; next: back2back walk in one direction, one partner goes down, other free falls while extending arms; from little animal, one person to the side, other on top, and stand up again (watch out that first upper body upright, and then go upwards), pay attention to not lose the connection (back, lower and upper, and even head)
* stand up, walk, find a place in room. small dance (involuntary micromovements to keep balanced/stand upright), close eyes. breathe. unlock knees. ground... move head left/right, open eyes, checkout others, who is grounded, who not. keep looking outwards into space (dont drawn inwards, like ecstatic dance, stay with the big body). now double the grounding, shift weight (pendulum, not metronom). caress the ground with pointed toes, move hand, arms, ribcage. octopus quality. breathe. smile and look at others. start walking. in negative space move. also look behind yourself with your back.
* 3x3x3: orbit around another center. no eye contact, not front2front. maybe trio. no contact first. slow down much. find backs, share weight, breathe out... 5,4,3,2,1... bye. shake it off. walk around. after 3rd: find a comfortable position for both. let them talk a bit, drink. back to big circle. sharing. next!
* consent exercises: coming closer, waving 12345, different ways approaching. push, partner says "stop", we say thank you.
* how to enter and leave a duette. a few rovers. game: in trio, try that other 2 cant dance with each other.
* let your partner move freely, and sometimes say "pause" to pause them, and then say "breathe, ground, sense"
  * after a few seconds, when they did and felt did, they continue on their own again
  * add on: tell them additionally "slow/fast/up/down" and pause them
* "double the grounding"
  * first start with a small-dance
  * then shift your weight from one to other leg, stay low (prepare to lift + spiral); toes keep touching the ground
  * not metronome like movement ("cutting the ground"), fixed-extended legs (not A shape but U shape, going low)
  * later necessary to walk as a base while partner is on top of you (instead of static lift and not move)
  * lastly add speed, spiral (in all 3 planes), without losing that quality
partner touches 2 points, and you connect those (decide which one is starting and end point; A & B)
  * now imagine (use visualization) a line connecting those 2 points, and move through them (wave=simple, spiral=advanced)
  * add-on: do the same (touch 2 points), but now start with one point on the ground and roll on the floor to the other point
    * no jumping point of contact! imagine you are painting your body by touching the ground (some body parts are impossible; neck, armpit, knee pit); sometimes you need to be very creative/exploratory, rotating your limbs and "weird" positions to get there
  * it's all about learning bulging out every part of your body, to later on stay in (rolling point of) contact
* floorwork
  * 1) lie on ground, starfish to shrimp (L/R) movement, and banana in-between; do it fast/slow
  * 2) barrel: lie sideways, roll other side, both arms/legs different "range", do it with pause (partner says); most difficult: close/open range; common mistake to push yourself from a limb, no! contract your limbs towards the center
  * 3) combine both, starfish and barrel; start with one or the other; or: barrel but with octopus free limbs
* HOMO/CONTRA LATERAL:
  * dance with partner, change yourself the mode (unnoticeable for the other)
    * plus: guess your partner's mode
  * also connect with those two: shoulders/hips, elbows/knees, wrists/ankles (when one bends/extends, the other does so too)
    * being precise is more important than being fast (if you can do it slow, you can do it fast; if you do it fast only, you can't do it properly)
    * add octopus quality to it + eyes into the space (no hyper-focus, but relax)
    * change for yourself the mode (be very deliberate in it): 1) homo 2) contra 3) free (octopus quality)

* SPIRAL:
  * 1) stand, rotate your body, moving from : { feet, ankles, knees, pelvis, torso, shoulders, head }
  * 2) then activate hands to support/initiate; goal: priming of spirals
  * spiraling your arms crossing shoulder-height is difficult
  * 3) full spirals (use momentum of arms to rotate 360 degrees); playing with kinetic/potential energy
    * going down and up, more dynamic
* SPIRAL:
  * 1) from X-position (arms/legs) lying on the ground, turn on other side (belly-back)
  * either starting from fingers/toes, wrists/ankles, elbows/knees, hips/shoulders (be precise! don't cheat)
  * 2) let your partner pull you; creating a nice line through your body
  * 3) let your partner touch a point where from to move; easy ones (joints), difficult ones (bones), almost impossible ones (chest, face, arm-/knee-pit)
* SPIRAL:
  * from X-position, turn 90 degrees (plus turn on other side); one arm/leg goes down, other up
  * after 4 turns, you are on the same spot again; try to go fast and continuous
* SPIRAL: little animal: the other person "crossed-starfish"-technique over
  * either arm/leg first, either same-side/over ending
* spirals practiced on the ground: now apply them as flyer on a base being (hip-)lifted
* SPIRAL: on the ground, lying, do: 1) on-ground octopus 2) off-ground octopus (and keep limbs alive!) 3) banana
* SPIRAL "srolling": sliding + rolling
  * being on 90 degrees on the back of your partner, and the rolling (banana) while staying on the same place through sliding
  * sliding happens when the base is making upper body more upright (more vertical)
  * base helps a looot with arms and pelvis to keep flyer balanced


* EXERCISE: make the qualities/engagements of floating/grounding synchronous and asynchronous (inverted) while up/down
  * e.g. simplest one is look up/down, breathing, tension, pelvis tilt, bend/extending
* EXERCISE: with a partner: 1) focus on up 2) focus on down 3) focus on changing 4) free
  * see how it goes, as when both up, it's rather unstable (no lifts possible), etc...
* RELAXATION EXERCISE: mama+baby bear (plus bit back massage), change roles, rolling around, transition into (floor) dance, surrender and keep centers connected
* PELVIS mobility exercise: imaginary clock, move along, wide movement
  * e.g.: 6/12, 7/1, 8/2, 9/3, 10/4, 11/5, ... and also other direction; be super precise
  * first put hands on front below belly button + back on sacrum
  * then additionally have floating-octopus arm
  * this is important for being a proper base when lifting, providing a "launch pad" (valley) and also let him down smoothly (otherwise "jump down" necessary for flyer)
* EXERCISE: simple hip-lifts
  * front2back: flyer use chicken wing wrap around shoulder (lateral direction); base use hand on partner's upper leg to stabilize
  * back2back: first base goes down, head between scapula; then bend forwards and scoop (consider size difference!)
  * front2back diagonal: one moves upper body right, other left, and side-ways hip-lift
  * classical hip-lift: backend of base on flyer's chest, step in (same side leg)
    * move pelvis into your partner; flyer is leaning as a plank forward into (don't hinge from your pelvis; see acro-yoga)
    * other base's hand is doing a snap sound (hand other side as body moves) and arm stretched to indicate direction of flyer
    * offer a valley, by rotating your pelvis, look to the flyer
    * arms are guarding: hover one arm above the leg (offer as leverage, don't manipulate too much, don't grab), other arm below chest
* ADVANCED hip lift: side2side, opposite direction facing
  * embrace (hug) partner's pelvis bone (not too high), base moves pelvis forward and sideways, to be underneath flyer's (both try to find center-matching for on-balance position)
  * flyer leans backwards when invited, both have their safety "seat belts" on; flyer is back-bent (scary! breathe)
  * flyer spirals down; base tries to do steps to keep moving, and supports flyer to go down (slight manipulation/support)
  * CAVE: release arm early enough, otherwise it might dislocate
* KOALA lift technique: stay close to the partner and aim high! base goes down a bit, helps up, use chicken wing+leg
  * building on top of koala: shoulder lift: be able to kick (use "healthy amount" of momentum)
    * when going down, use a spiral movement
* EXERCISE: partner holds arms in, you push sideways open as hard as possible for about 20 seconds
  * then let arms float up "by themselves" => that's the floating quality we are looking for; remember this sensation during the float-dance (being light)
* EXERCISE: A moves freestyle, B says "pause - breathe - sense", and then touch 1/2 body parts, and A floats from those
* EXERCISE: in trio, C is dancing close in negative space; says "pause" A+B close eyes, and C touches each one point, from where the move/float from
  * when couple dances, the 3rd is a "rover", not just standing there, almost like "being in their aura", very close-by; being part of it, not just stand there, arms crossed
  * use this quality also during the "warm-up walking", or on the dance floor; secretly dance with everyone (and enjoy the feeling of belonging, not feeling lonely in a group, but being with everyone)
* EXERCISE: front2back, person standing behind lifts partner, wrap arms around his belly
  * 1) partner is neutral 2) partner is floating (light, easy) 3) partner is grounded (heavy, some kgs heavier felt)
  * then let your partner guess in which state you were
* EXERCISE SEQUENCE: typical hip lift + handstand (inner leg first; base is helping so flyer is rotated open a bit; watch out proper hand position) + shoulder lift
* EXERCISE: back-lift + handstand: hugging each other sideways (opp. direction facing), one lifts partner back, other makes handstand and flip forwards (away from base)


* OBSERVE yourself, 4 qualities
  1) breathe: deep, conscious, don't hold it
  2) sense: your muscle tonality, e.g. when you are unbalanced, usually tense up; like doing a constant body-scan
  3) space: being aware of the room, the corners of it, the space between people, the people (big body), look out and away (not staring or looking down)
  4) interact: see the others, move with them, see/analyze where they are in those qualities, being playful/act
  * reflect now: what's your good/bad? comfort zone, and where not anymore?
  * some qualities might be there, but you are just not aware of them
  * we prefer a sinus-wave like manifestation of those 4 qualities: round, continuous
    * no sharp/unexpected/sudden/abrupt changes in it (spikes in the curve)
    * yet again: you can break this rule if you know what you are doing, using it as a deliberate spice in a safe/controlled way
* ASSISTED GROUND
  * A pushes B down, helping him to be more grounded
  * B is in small dance mode
  * push down on (with both hands): feet, then hips/pelvis, maybe ribs, shoulders, head.
  * only vertically for now, slowly in/out, and symmetrical for now
  * CONT: now asymmetrical; e.g. one head, the other shoulder
    * B needs to compensate to maintain structure upright
    * B needs to rearrange (change (feet) position to stay)
    * be aware of what the body is implicitly doing;
  * CONT: horizontal pressure as well; asymmetric
  * use hands first, then other body parts; transition into free dance
* not done, but also nice:
  * compress different body parts, squeeze them between hands
  * CONTINUATION: start to push horizontal, slowly (cat walk) change positions; imprinting a spiral movement possible
  * lean body against
  * ALSO: do it in trios: two partners use each one hand; then body parts squeezing between; transition free dance
* breathe-sense-ground exercise (same as from previous workshop)
  * first duo; partner dances in negative space, says "3-2-1-pause", then:
    * breathe: relax, soften
    * sense: body scan, detect tonus, awareness
    * ground: release, feel soles of feet
  * CONT: after grounding, push 2 vectors into partner's body to ground more; push into bone stacks, or to spice up also horizontally (spirals maybe)
  * VARIATION in trios: two dance, one rover saying the same thing
    * dancers close eyes, rover touches point on each (only single finger, be precise!) and move from there
* back2back with 50cm distance, tap into small dance, slowly come closer
  * stay in this position for some time, share the small dance
  * slowly transition into free dance while maintaining that quality/sensitivity (unfortunately that "magic" is lost sometimes quickly/easily)
* simple exercise (no dance):
  * with partner, one tells the other to "collapse!", going down super quick (keep head tension for safety), give each other feedback/research
  * CONT: use another command: "yield"; go super slowly to the ground
  * CONT: also upwards (only yield, cant collapse upwards)
* partner negative space rover; gives commands: "pause" + { yield / collapse / push} (can also "halfway collapse")
  * pause implies breathe-sense-ground
* (gaga) tonality exercise: cement - honey - water - air
  * once we did it in duos; this time the whole group all together (teacher giving commands while dancing in quality; then "5...4..." and state new quality)
  * no speed difference is necessary; air can also be slow, not only cement
  * do it even down to the fingers
* rover partner says "pause", then touch 2 points and command A) "move", then do like spiral or B) "tense" and each muscle separately/differentiated
  * connect those two points in whichever direction you want; be precise, take time!
* "rod-chain" (stick-ricebag, yield-tense/superman)
  * 1) from little animal position or 2) from classical hip lift
  * easiest is belly, then sideways, most difficult from back!
* grounding with distraction
  * walking, some decide to do a small dance (determine yourself)
  * eyes closed may be easier, open more difficult (distractions)
  * then walk again on your own will
  * goal: stay grounded while others walk around; keep sensation
* start with partner in very slow dance; pause now and then: be aware of the shared center of mass
  * move/play with it; consciously move it around, change its size
  * be conscious about 4 qualities
* bodywork-like: A lies like starfish, B pulls parts 1) upper leg 2) lower leg 3) foot 4) toes
  * then opposite arm 1) upper arm 2) lower arm 3) hand 4) fingers
  * then other cross-side
  * more proximal more pull strength, at very distal only little force; take time, nice fade-in/out
  * A tries to keep the extension of the body, keeps semi-relaxed, some yielding, but no "against" and no collapsing into it
  * imprint reaching sensation into A
* use lifting positions (little animal, classical hip lift, ...)
  * instead chain-rod exercise, now: reach, exhale, and extend further
  * CONT: spiral; and when land then yield+ground immediately
* roving-choreographer says "3-2-1-pause"
  * give 1 or 2 points; from there extend (to avoid not only from fingers/toes)
  * dancers take time, go slow, experience and research properly (be much in your head = present/conscious/aware/attention/focus)
* do basically the same but in a trio (third roving-choreographer)
  * giving 1 point each, move from there
  * after saying "3-2-1-pause", do the good old (but without it being instructed) breathe-sense-ground
  * difficult to stay connected with partner when starting to extend

* handstand shoulderlift (do it in trios, or even quartetts)
  * 1) prime in warm up movement from the head. head, leading. use eyes. spiral. breathe. move fingers. and: don't bump!
  * 2) start with partner standing behind you, both of his hands on your shoulder blades, giving oomph
    * now walk around together, while partner is always keeping his hands on your back, sliding it (no rolling point of contact) on the back, shoulder blades, lower back, pelvis...
    * walk while leading your movement from the head, your partner still connected.
    * continuation: every now and then, i position myself in gorilla and stop for a moment, inviting partner to jump a bit (using her hands to push into me, a lift to jump)
  * 3) show your handstand abilities.
    * no need to stay long in it, just with straight legs going up, and down. possibly do it against a wall.
    * do not throw your legs, but going down with your arms first, and then controlled handstand.
    * show it to each other. safeguard each other.
    * CAVE: do it "more" one-legged. one goes higher up, and the same goes down again (don't switch mid-air, otherwise partner will "fall into a hole").
  * 4) now me doing quick handstand, partner standing "behind".
    * catching one leg (not both) with open palm (not really grab, just stop it); when i go down with my other leg, partner lets go.
  * 5) now partner catching leg, and follows me with his hand.
    * while doing so, i go towards her, she walks with me (backwards) keeping same distance.
    * either same side hand, then slide to pelvis, and other hand on shoulderblade. or crossed, then slide to shoulder blade, and other find pelvis.
    * i go directly into gorilla, and partner jumps on me quickly.
    * tip: when i stay low, and turn a bit towards her, then it's easier for her to jump.
  * 6) final build up: i go in her direction, she maintains distance, i do a handstand, and when i go down again, i shoulder lift her
     * start first with an "artificial" (if enough strength). slow. without momentum.
     * i need to create a bit of distance so she can jump (controlled, timed, soft).
     * she can stay with one hand on my body, to have a feeling for distance and softer landing.
     * ALTERNATIVE: for those who don't want to do it, either stay being a guardian angel, or stay with the previous exercise
  * this happens when i walk forward, and my partner next to me backwards. i can see that as an invitation to do a handstand and see whether she picks it up (or not). just watch out to kick no one in the face.
