* stand up, walk, find a place in room
    * small dance (involuntary micromovements to keep balanced/stand upright), close eyes
    * breathe. unlock knees. ground... move head left/right, open eyes, checkout others, who is grounded, who not
    * keep looking outwards into space (dont drawn inwards, like ecstatic dance, stay with the big body)
    * now double the grounding, shift weight (pendulum, not metronom)
    * caress the ground with pointed toes, move hand, arms, ribcage. octopus quality. breathe. smile and look at others
    * start walking. in negative space move. also look behind yourself with your back.

* 3x3x3:
  * orbit around another center
  * no eye contact, not front2front. maybe trio. no contact first. slow down much.
  * find backs, share weight, breathe out...
  * 5,4,3,2,1... bye
  * shake it off. walk around.
  * ...
  * after 3rd:
    * find a comfortable position for both.
    * let them talk a bit, drink.
    * back to big circle. sharing. next!
