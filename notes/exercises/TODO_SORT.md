TEACHING
================================================================
* build up: start - middle/core - end
  * start { talk, share, sense, aware, walk, trust }
  * middle { exercise, layered, research }
    * single exercise build up:
      * demonstrate: pick/ask for volunteer, me on him (describe/diagnose/comment), then him on me, note where's my emphasize
      * open mic: for questions; confirm with "all clear?" -let's go (music ON)
      * execute and guide: walk around, give feedback, intermediate stop if necessary for group feedback; guide through giving cues, layers/sequences; switch partners
      * share: with partner, then with whole group
  * end { free play, wind down, slow, recover, conclusion }

EXERCISES
================================================================

* ad level of contact/depth
  * from osteopathy: hand onlying partner, take loooots of time, going through layers: fabrics clothes, hair, skin, fat, blood vessels, fascia, muscles, fascia, bones... and all the way back again.
  * dance and have different levels with different body parts; be super conscious about it
    * easily tempted to use sliding contact with skin touch; try to stay with rolling point
  * trio, 1 in middle, 2 other adapt to depth level (qualities of contact) of one in the


* HOMO/CONTRA LATERAL:
  * dance with partner, change yourself the mode (unnoticeable for the other)
    * plus: guess your partner's mode
  * also connect with those two: shoulders/hips, elbows/knees, wrists/ankles (when one bends/extends, the other does so too)
    * being precise is more important than being fast (if you can do it slow, you can do it fast; if you do it fast only, you can't do it properly)
    * add octopus quality to it + eyes into the space (no hyper-focus, but relax)
    * change for yourself the mode (be very deliberate in it): 1) homo 2) contra 3) free (octopus quality)

* SPIRAL:
  * 1) stand, rotate your body, moving from : { feet, ankles, knees, pelvis, torso, shoulders, head }
  * 2) then activate hands to support/initiate; goal: priming of spirals
  * spiraling your arms crossing shoulder-height is difficult
  * 3) full spirals (use momentum of arms to rotate 360 degrees); playing with kinetic/potential energy
    * going down and up, more dynamic
* SPIRAL:
  * 1) from X-position (arms/legs) lying on the ground, turn on other side (belly-back)
  * either starting from fingers/toes, wrists/ankles, elbows/knees, hips/shoulders (be precise! don't cheat)
  * 2) let your partner pull you; creating a nice line through your body
  * 3) let your partner touch a point where from to move; easy ones (joints), difficult ones (bones), almost impossible ones (chest, face, arm-/knee-pit)
* SPIRAL:
  * from X-position, turn 90 degrees (plus turn on other side); one arm/leg goes down, other up
  * after 4 turns, you are on the same spot again; try to go fast and continuous

* SPIRAL "srolling": sliding + rolling
  * being on 90 degrees on the back of your partner, and the rolling (banana) while staying on the same place through sliding
  * sliding happens when the base is making upper body more upright (more vertical)
  * base helps a looot with arms and pelvis to keep flyer balanced


* make the qualities/engagements of floating/grounding synchronous and asynchronous (inverted) while up/down
  * e.g. simplest one is look up/down, breathing, tension, pelvis tilt, bend/extending
* with a partner: 1) focus on up 2) focus on down 3) focus on changing 4) free
  * see how it goes, as when both up, it's rather unstable (no lifts possible), etc...

* PELVIS mobility exercise: imaginary clock, move along, wide movement
  * e.g.: 6/12, 7/1, 8/2, 9/3, 10/4, 11/5, ... and also other direction; be super precise
  * first put hands on front below belly button + back on sacrum
  * then additionally have floating-octopus arm
  * this is important for being a proper base when lifting, providing a "launch pad" (valley) and also let him down smoothly (otherwise "jump down" necessary for flyer)


* back2back with 50cm distance, tap into small dance, slowly come closer
  * stay in this position for some time, share the small dance
  * slowly transition into free dance while maintaining that quality/sensitivity (unfortunately that "magic" is lost sometimes quickly/easily)

* rover partner says "pause", then touch 2 points and command A) "move", then do like spiral or B) "tense" and each muscle separately/differentiated
  * connect those two points in whichever direction you want; be precise, take time!

* start with partner in very slow dance; pause now and then: be aware of the shared center of mass
  * move/play with it; consciously move it around, change its size
  * be conscious about 4 qualities

* use lifting positions (little animal, classical hip lift, ...)
  * instead chain-rod exercise, now: reach, exhale, and extend further
  * CONT: spiral; and when land then yield+ground immediately

* trio:
  * third roving-choreographer says "3-2-1-pause" 
  * giving 1 point each, move from there
  * after saying "3-2-1-pause", do the good old (but without it being instructed) breathe-sense-ground
  * difficult to stay connected with partner when starting to extend


* EXERCISE: stand, close eyes; with palm, very quickly go down, and stop very quickly and try to hover 1cm above the ground.
* soft landing:
  * partner is with his ear on the ground (maybe at first hand in between, otherwise too loud); eyes closed
  * other partner(s) walks around, try to walk silently
  * then jumps and land soundless
  * partner on ground says "now" when hears landing
  * goal is that partner never has to say it

* EXERCISE: spirals
  * first stand (later walk around)
  * draw circles with your finger(s); change axis/plane; change direction
  * move axis inside the body and out again
  * walk around and turn while drawing your circles
  * increase complexity: inspiring spiral movements; from arms to: spine/torso, pelvis, knees, ...
  * CONT: slow down, make movements larger
    * draw curves (instead of spirals), almost like lines
  * CONT: find a partner
    * follow their curves as if they are "snail traces in space"
    * then catch up with them (not only follow, but take over), and extend the movement, accelerating their spirals
  * LALA land instruction: add spiral not from arms/body, but from space around (arm pits, etc.)
  * motivates visualization skills, seeing those trails in space; like when a camera with long exposure time, lights being moved
  * sliding on them, projecting/extrapolating them
  * esp. in trio, take from A, and "put into" B
  * tap into the qualities, internalize them "magically" (=without much conscious awareness/thought)

* from spirals workshop
  * lie on back, partner takes head; first just weight, hands on ground; take lots of time, slowly
  * when more than 45 degrees, start to move with (open eyes!)
  * slowly stand up
  * supportive partner enhancing spiral movements, see his pathways
  * one hand on head, other on body
  * 2 phases: 1) give impulses (lead/follow) 2) partner generates spirals himself (self-sufficient/independent)
  * then: join in with your body, manipulate with the box (instead with the hands)
  * great exercise to learn new pathways
  * but: it's an exercise/practice, not "applied CI/dance"
    * not egalitarian, it has a hierarchy, leader/follower; also no sharing weight, not improvised but directed
  * knowledge about anatomy is of use, playing on the edges of possibilities
    * not dislocating a joint, playing safe, but using joints limitations to push into the center
      * head has highest leverage: small push, big impact
* spirals: with partner, 1 crossed arms, other straight arms
  * touching palms (no grabing, ever!)
  * push quite a lot, for support/stability
  * lifting (search for center) with "y-hands", partner needs to bend wrists, push against, to lift up
  * OPTIONAL: 3rd person (=satellite) seeing spirals in space, and suggesting them, helping duette to embody them
    * without touch, just "draw in space", being like a conductor
    * VARIATION: 3rd person is going to just touch a bit, stroke, draw lines on body to "inject"/extend pathways, giving impulses, actualizing potential spirals
  * don't go on the floor
  * don't over-commit to the hand touch (use as landing gear if needed, don't fall on your nose to maintain hand connection)
  * after a lift, palm-pressure nice to push partner into a spiral
  * satellite is mostly a guardian angel, esp. during lifts; seeing, training eyes

* fun game: after a dance, come up with a movie title fitting the dance, e.g. "kampf der giganten"

* palm-palm pressure, stay connected (can "slide/rotate", they are not glued, but don't grab); some call it "looping"
  * either A) both straight or B) one straight, other crossed
  * through limitation (glueing), we are forced to discover new moves/pathways (creativity); to inspire spirals
-  in trios, designated "main focus partner"
  - pouring weight exercise for going up/down: partnered squad with back2back (breathe, look, move)
  - round 1: stand in front of each other, "appropriate" distance, arms away front, palms facing to partner; fall forward, pour weight, catch-stretch; other 2 switch each time; relax the joints
  - round 2: when contact, roll to one side (communicate it non-verbally), push into
  - round 3: include going down/up; advanced: use single/tiny/small point of contact for going down/up; maybe switch/move/roll while going down/up



PELVIS
=================================================================
* for pelvis mobility: do monty pythons silly walk during warm up
* EXERCISE: show pelvis to your partner. she's touching yours. exploring it.
  * first get consent, what's ok, what isn't. go deep into the bone tissue.
    * follow all the structures of the pelvis on all sides. get an internal visual representation of it.
  * also, choose to completely step out of this exercise (anxiety, intimacy, fear, boundaries).
  * use a fabric, and put it like a diaper, back-front, covering anus and genitals (if wish to do so).
  * maybe also touch your own, then compare it with your partner's
* EXERCISE: draw pelvis on paper
  * 1x (1 page) the anatomically/technical correct one (as much as you can/know)
  * 1x (another A4 paper) a creative/artistic version of your interpretation of a pelvis
    * hand-out paper and pen, put them in a row on the edge of the room
  * after finished drawing, show the "proper solution" and do a group sharing
  * then do a sharing with your partner; reflect
    * what was easy/difficult. how is it now (your understanding of pelvis)? compare with your drawing.
  * also know: where the psoas is connected (L1-L5 and proxi-medial femur); obturator foramen; where the main artery goes through; etc.
* EXERCISE: stand, small dance, feel femur bone
  * explore: try to be one-legged; use muscles instead of structure; play with different positions
  * then go down to the FLOOR:
    * roll on the floor, feel the bone structures and pelvis skeleton (femur, trochanter major, ilium/ischium/pubis, sacrum...)
    * research for 3 highlights, and once done, share it with same partner (as before).
* partner exercise: have your hands around the pelvis bone of your band; stand behind them
  * A: standing
    * 1: ground them first by pushing them down at pelvis bone (typical grounding exercise)
    * 2: they move, you follow their movement (only passive! no manipulation, yet)
    * 3: occasionally send impulses yourself (receive 80%, send 20%)
      * partner decides: go with it or resist it deliberately
  * B: walking together
    * follow partner at first; listen only... let him do freely.
    * then occasionally send counter-impulses; play with saying "no" occasionally; "sumo fighter" mode
    * then partner always has to say "YES" to it (the best way to learn new movement patterns)
      * play with very soft impulses, very light/subtle
  * ADDON: only give touch impulses, let go of constant touch
  * ADDON: use your legs/pelvis/center to manipulate (instead of hands)
* pelvis mobility EXERCISE:
  * walk the cat walk, like models to, exaggerate pelvis swing
  * then extremely isolate the pelvis, no movement in the shoulder
  * then only shoulders
  * then both
  * then none; just regular walking; experience how easy that is
  * CONT: walk next to a person. feel/sense their center
    * engage and disengage with several people; play a bit
    * then touch-contact via shoulders only, walk next to each other for a while
    * then take a 180 degrees turn by using rolling point of contact
* solo EXERCISE: pelvis (girdle) and upper body (shoulder girdle) separation
  * 1: move them freely together
  * 2: one is leading the other (switch)
  * 3: one is moving, the other totally still (switch)
  * put your hand on your lower belly and the other on sternum (switch hand, as we have one dominant)
    * first close your eyes, then move both parts
    * then walk... (find a partner)
* start back2back, shoulder blades have contact, dance there 1 min (give weight)
  * then change contact to pelvises, send impulses (with pelvis/from center) just as we did with hands before
    * A: rotational push (1 side), spiral/turn
    * B: linear push, straight; advanced: wave motion
    * C: combine both (super advanced)
    * + use upper legs to manipulate/"pedipulate" (good balance required)
* pelvis clock advanced exercise: in all 3 planes
  * build-up: do body scan, apply the clock on the floor, and with this sensitivity apply with partner (floor dance)

* EXERCISE: free dance, try to have 30% of the time center2center connection (use no hands!)
  * monitor your own pelvis, pay attention to it
  * also be able to quickly connect to your partner's (when you "sense" it, you know where it is in space, and immediately go for it)
* group EXERCISE: in trios, discuss definition and relations; present group-result to big group; plus discussion
  * define "centering" (similar as did in previous workshop with grounding/yielding)
  * also: how centering relates to grounding
  * => see homework of preparing definitions
* floor EXERCISE/core workout:
  * 1: starfish-shrimp (with partner-teacher); first slow then fast
    * watch out for mistakes: lifting limbs (always on the ground), bending limbs (have them stretched out)
    * CONT: partner gives oomph on lower belly (below belly button)
      * push down while partner on back, and then towards yourself (partner rolling "away side") to give a bit of a counter-push
  * 2: starfish-ball: lie on the back, starfish position; then quickly contract to the smallest ball possible (even with head)
    * do it very fast; also going down again; stop 1 cm before the ground, and then land softly (without any sound!)
    * watch out to do it not too often, as your iliopsoas might hurt quickly (right after, or next day)
    * CONT: partner touches belly, which is the signal to do it; like a heavy ball dropping onto you
* teacher-partnered EXERCISE:
  * build core strength and yet keeping relaxed... soft yet strong; taijiquan iron-wool metaphor
  * doing octopus on the ground; start with 2 commands: UP (hands/feet always off floor), DOWN (hands/feet always touch ground)
  * teachers are the helmet for the partner, so they don't get kicked!
  * CONT: add command PAUSE (freeze for a moment; that partner decides self when to continue)
  * CONT: after pause, add 1 point where partner moves from
  * CONT: now add 2 points
  * tip: observe your partner carefully and touch point where he seems to have a "gap/blind spot"
* TRIO exercise:
  * 1 on the floor lying, 2 are the "standing obstacles"
  * obstacles step around, blocking the path (with firm legs)
  * person on the floor tries to get through obstacles while using the same skill of octopus up/down before
    * don't lift center/pelvis from ground; don't grab; leverage/hooks are ok
  * it's not about "winning" (shows your personality)
    * also not about challenging yourself so much; explore also the easy solutions; experience the full range
* EXERCISE: from starfish, to shrimp, to little animal (and crawl sideways)
  * arm+leg in direction where you want to go, go down first
  * variation: reach into that direction with arm+leg goes into that direction (as if someone would pull you); keep it extended (no shrimp)
  * if there is a little elephant sound here while landing, it will mean danger later on
  * CAVE: in little animal, head always above ass. also now when "going up"/transitioning from lying position.
* EXERCISE body surf:
  * idea for pre-EXERCISE: do the 90 degrees starfish exercise
  * tip for base: push into leg to start roll if partner is on you, otherwise difficult to engage only from core
    * keep periphery always on the ground; as did before
  * CONT: do it in trios: 1 base and 2 surfers (they run behind quickly to make it continuously)
  * how much weight? depends on { partners size/weight/strength }; 40-80% (not nothing, rarely everything)
    * base needs weight for keeping momentum of rolling; to maintain connection
    * when it has to be only 10-30%, always be with your belly on your partner, to be able to take weight off into hands/feet
  * CAVE: fast movement (=heavy weight) on floating ribs is one of the most common injuries in CI
    * prefer to roll over pelvis and lower back; especially pelvis can carry a LOT of weight
  * keep limbs on the ground (also nice to push a bit), as doing the barrel will not give you much/any strength


MISC
========================================================================================================================
* warm up exercise: "triangulation (triangularity?) of dance"
  * to feel and fill the space (with body+presence)
  * negative (air) vs positive (body, matter) space
  * start to meet other bodies, "grazing"

* power of imagination:
  * like for grounding/flying => feather/boulder exercise
  * or: "Two Against One"
    * 1 person pushes against 2
    * the 2 push the 1 backwards, to the edge of their strength
    * lesson: find ground/center, push with all strength
    * NOW: imagine someone stealing baby, firefilled pit behind them, and see the difference in the result of effort being put in
* Push and Drop
  * 1 stands rooted, 2nd is assistant and pushes slowly; 1st equalizes amount of push to stay centered
  * NOW: 2nd abruptly pulls hand away while pushing; 1st needs to not fall into the hole created; keep rooted down, not lean/push against
  * usually people throw arms up, rise to regain center, BUT: better to drop, regain/firmer connection to the ground
* CENTER:
  * 1) peripherically look at partner, and copy the level of pelvis (not the rest of the movement); only vertical (1 plane)
  * 2) oomph hand on sacrum, and use as remote control to copy movement in 3D space
  * 3) hip lift: belly2back with crowning; then diagonal classical lift 
* two partners stand in front of each other; arm length away
  * palms touching, ground, lean slowly forward; share weight (bend arms), and push out again; leaning forward, gently
  * CONT: also pull, lean back, hook hands (don't grab!)
    * watch for plan position VS bending knees/pelvis; don't go too far (catch yourself!)
  * CONT: 3rd person is standing behind a partner
    * first catch with hands when is leaning back and letting go (totally release into, and push back again)
      * say "i am here"; maybe creating more distance (but not too far)
    * then catch with back; or even move around and catch with any part
* spinal awareness
  * A) your partner spinal curls down and up, like qigong exercise; the bending parnter leads, tapping follows
    * maybe first tap next to spine, the m. errector spinae, where partner is bending (highest point)
    * next round, walk with fingers along the spine (directly on it)
  * B) put hands on back head and sacrum; manipulate him (change lead/follow), give signals how to move
  * C) change hands with your whole body (first back2back, then more free)
    * every now and then give strong signals how to move, make him desorientated
    * help figure out new pathways (a bit like tantric dance)
