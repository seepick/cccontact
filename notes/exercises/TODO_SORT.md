TEACHING
================================================================
* build up: start - middle/core - end
  * start { talk, share, sense, aware, walk, trust }
  * middle { exercise, layered, research }
  * end { free play, wind down, slow, recover, conclusion }
  * ad middle part: single exercise build up:
    * demonstrate: pick/ask for volunteer, me on him (describe/diagnose/comment), then him on me, note where's my emphasize
    * open mic: for questions; confirm with "all clear?" -let's go (music ON)
    * execute and guide: walk around, give feedback, intermediate stop if necessary for group feedback; guide through giving cues, layers/sequences; switch partners
    * share: with partner, then with whole group

EXERCISES
================================================================

=> harvest CI Zagreb workshop => put in wiki

* ad level of contact/depth
  * from osteopathy: hand onlying partner, take loooots of time, going through layers: fabrics clothes, hair, skin, fat, blood vessels, fascia, muscles, fascia, bones... and all the way back again.
  * dance and have different levels with different body parts; be super conscious about it
    * easily tempted to use sliding contact with skin touch; try to stay with rolling point
  * trio, 1 in middle, 2 other adapt to depth level (qualities of contact) of one in the
* from knee sitting, other partner is standing on the side, pelvis&shoulders connect; from knee sitting into little animal, other partner goes with (sharing weight, yet sliding point of contact); and then A) fingers pointing away (easier) or B) towards the partner (more difficult). roll over partner, maybe with a small kick, make sure center-on-center (balanced; have a pause, break, verify you are stable, thus having all the options available again). go down on same or other side. stay in contact! don't lose oomph quality! for the base: you move, lower, support, push where needed.
* bodysurf: start sitting back2back; legs bent (can push). one partner reaches stretched arms up and to one side, going onto his belly. other partner goes over, from other side, with his back on the lying partner (stay on the back, no spiral, otherwise no continuation easily possible; in this exercise). important: base is chicken-wing hooking the upper partner to ensure the centers are connected; also helps with the flyer, when he "drops", to use this as leverage to get up, ending into seated position again.
* sit side2side, both spread legs; one partner rolls over between other's legs, reaching arm between first; then is upside down (weird/funny position, butt towards other's chest). stay very close to center (don't put weight on legs, painful); stay slow & controlled. sitting partner helps rolling partner with arms to roll over. also possible with 3 people (2 people back2back and 1 "roller")
* rolls: alone, animal, standing
  * 1) aikido roll; in lanes on the ground
  * 2) on little animal (continuous, like did with yvette): in trios, guardian angel, saying "over" or "under"
  * 3) standing: more difficult&dangerous, only for advanced
* start back2back, going down and up via squad; next: back2back walk in one direction, one partner goes down, other free falls while extending arms; from little animal, one person to the side, other on top, and stand up again (watch out that first upper body upright, and then go upwards), pay attention to not lose the connection (back, lower and upper, and even head)
* stand up, walk, find a place in room. small dance (involuntary micromovements to keep balanced/stand upright), close eyes. breathe. unlock knees. ground... move head left/right, open eyes, checkout others, who is grounded, who not. keep looking outwards into space (dont drawn inwards, like ecstatic dance, stay with the big body). now double the grounding, shift weight (pendulum, not metronom). caress the ground with pointed toes, move hand, arms, ribcage. octopus quality. breathe. smile and look at others. start walking. in negative space move. also look behind yourself with your back.
* 3x3x3: orbit around another center. no eye contact, not front2front. maybe trio. no contact first. slow down much. find backs, share weight, breathe out... 5,4,3,2,1... bye. shake it off. walk around. after 3rd: find a comfortable position for both. let them talk a bit, drink. back to big circle. sharing. next!
* consent exercises: coming closer, waving 12345, different ways approaching. push, partner says "stop", we say thank you.
* how to enter and leave a duette. a few rovers. game: in trio, try that other 2 cant dance with each other.
* let your partner move freely, and sometimes say "pause" to pause them, and then say "breathe, ground, sense"
  * after a few seconds, when they did and felt did, they continue on their own again
  * add on: tell them additionally "slow/fast/up/down" and pause them
* "double the grounding"
  * first start with a small-dance
  * then shift your weight from one to other leg, stay low (prepare to lift + spiral); toes keep touching the ground
  * not metronome like movement ("cutting the ground"), fixed-extended legs (not A shape but U shape, going low)
  * later necessary to walk as a base while partner is on top of you (instead of static lift and not move)
  * lastly add speed, spiral (in all 3 planes), without losing that quality
partner touches 2 points, and you connect those (decide which one is starting and end point; A & B)
  * now imagine (use visualization) a line connecting those 2 points, and move through them (wave=simple, spiral=advanced)
  * add-on: do the same (touch 2 points), but now start with one point on the ground and roll on the floor to the other point
    * no jumping point of contact! imagine you are painting your body by touching the ground (some body parts are impossible; neck, armpit, knee pit); sometimes you need to be very creative/exploratory, rotating your limbs and "weird" positions to get there
  * it's all about learning bulging out every part of your body, to later on stay in (rolling point of) contact
* floorwork
  * 1) lie on ground, starfish to shrimp (L/R) movement, and banana in-between; do it fast/slow
  * 2) barrel: lie sideways, roll other side, both arms/legs different "range", do it with pause (partner says); most difficult: close/open range; common mistake to push yourself from a limb, no! contract your limbs towards the center
  * 3) combine both, starfish and barrel; start with one or the other; or: barrel but with octopus free limbs
* HOMO/CONTRA LATERAL:
  * dance with partner, change yourself the mode (unnoticeable for the other)
    * plus: guess your partner's mode
  * also connect with those two: shoulders/hips, elbows/knees, wrists/ankles (when one bends/extends, the other does so too)
    * being precise is more important than being fast (if you can do it slow, you can do it fast; if you do it fast only, you can't do it properly)
    * add octopus quality to it + eyes into the space (no hyper-focus, but relax)
    * change for yourself the mode (be very deliberate in it): 1) homo 2) contra 3) free (octopus quality)

* SPIRAL:
  * 1) stand, rotate your body, moving from : { feet, ankles, knees, pelvis, torso, shoulders, head }
  * 2) then activate hands to support/initiate; goal: priming of spirals
  * spiraling your arms crossing shoulder-height is difficult
  * 3) full spirals (use momentum of arms to rotate 360 degrees); playing with kinetic/potential energy
    * going down and up, more dynamic
* SPIRAL:
  * 1) from X-position (arms/legs) lying on the ground, turn on other side (belly-back)
  * either starting from fingers/toes, wrists/ankles, elbows/knees, hips/shoulders (be precise! don't cheat)
  * 2) let your partner pull you; creating a nice line through your body
  * 3) let your partner touch a point where from to move; easy ones (joints), difficult ones (bones), almost impossible ones (chest, face, arm-/knee-pit)
* SPIRAL:
  * from X-position, turn 90 degrees (plus turn on other side); one arm/leg goes down, other up
  * after 4 turns, you are on the same spot again; try to go fast and continuous
* SPIRAL: little animal: the other person "crossed-starfish"-technique over
  * either arm/leg first, either same-side/over ending
* spirals practiced on the ground: now apply them as flyer on a base being (hip-)lifted
* SPIRAL: on the ground, lying, do: 1) on-ground octopus 2) off-ground octopus (and keep limbs alive!) 3) banana
* SPIRAL "srolling": sliding + rolling
  * being on 90 degrees on the back of your partner, and the rolling (banana) while staying on the same place through sliding
  * sliding happens when the base is making upper body more upright (more vertical)
  * base helps a looot with arms and pelvis to keep flyer balanced


* EXERCISE: make the qualities/engagements of floating/grounding synchronous and asynchronous (inverted) while up/down
  * e.g. simplest one is look up/down, breathing, tension, pelvis tilt, bend/extending
* EXERCISE: with a partner: 1) focus on up 2) focus on down 3) focus on changing 4) free
  * see how it goes, as when both up, it's rather unstable (no lifts possible), etc...
* RELAXATION EXERCISE: mama+baby bear (plus bit back massage), change roles, rolling around, transition into (floor) dance, surrender and keep centers connected
* PELVIS mobility exercise: imaginary clock, move along, wide movement
  * e.g.: 6/12, 7/1, 8/2, 9/3, 10/4, 11/5, ... and also other direction; be super precise
  * first put hands on front below belly button + back on sacrum
  * then additionally have floating-octopus arm
  * this is important for being a proper base when lifting, providing a "launch pad" (valley) and also let him down smoothly (otherwise "jump down" necessary for flyer)
* EXERCISE: simple hip-lifts
  * front2back: flyer use chicken wing wrap around shoulder (lateral direction); base use hand on partner's upper leg to stabilize
  * back2back: first base goes down, head between scapula; then bend forwards and scoop (consider size difference!)
  * front2back diagonal: one moves upper body right, other left, and side-ways hip-lift
  * classical hip-lift: backend of base on flyer's chest, step in (same side leg)
    * move pelvis into your partner; flyer is leaning as a plank forward into (don't hinge from your pelvis; see acro-yoga)
    * other base's hand is doing a snap sound (hand other side as body moves) and arm stretched to indicate direction of flyer
    * offer a valley, by rotating your pelvis, look to the flyer
    * arms are guarding: hover one arm above the leg (offer as leverage, don't manipulate too much, don't grab), other arm below chest
* ADVANCED hip lift: side2side, opposite direction facing
  * embrace (hug) partner's pelvis bone (not too high), base moves pelvis forward and sideways, to be underneath flyer's (both try to find center-matching for on-balance position)
  * flyer leans backwards when invited, both have their safety "seat belts" on; flyer is back-bent (scary! breathe)
  * flyer spirals down; base tries to do steps to keep moving, and supports flyer to go down (slight manipulation/support)
  * CAVE: release arm early enough, otherwise it might dislocate
* KOALA lift technique: stay close to the partner and aim high! base goes down a bit, helps up, use chicken wing+leg
  * building on top of koala: shoulder lift: be able to kick (use "healthy amount" of momentum)
    * when going down, use a spiral movement
* EXERCISE: partner holds arms in, you push sideways open as hard as possible for about 20 seconds
  * then let arms float up "by themselves" => that's the floating quality we are looking for; remember this sensation during the float-dance (being light)
* EXERCISE: A moves freestyle, B says "pause - breathe - sense", and then touch 1/2 body parts, and A floats from those
* EXERCISE: in trio, C is dancing close in negative space; says "pause" A+B close eyes, and C touches each one point, from where the move/float from
  * when couple dances, the 3rd is a "rover", not just standing there, almost like "being in their aura", very close-by; being part of it, not just stand there, arms crossed
  * use this quality also during the "warm-up walking", or on the dance floor; secretly dance with everyone (and enjoy the feeling of belonging, not feeling lonely in a group, but being with everyone)
* EXERCISE: front2back, person standing behind lifts partner, wrap arms around his belly
  * 1) partner is neutral 2) partner is floating (light, easy) 3) partner is grounded (heavy, some kgs heavier felt)
  * then let your partner guess in which state you were
* EXERCISE SEQUENCE: typical hip lift + handstand (inner leg first; base is helping so flyer is rotated open a bit; watch out proper hand position) + shoulder lift
* EXERCISE: back-lift + handstand: hugging each other sideways (opp. direction facing), one lifts partner back, other makes handstand and flip forwards (away from base)


* OBSERVE yourself, 4 qualities
  1) breathe: deep, conscious, don't hold it
  2) sense: your muscle tonality, e.g. when you are unbalanced, usually tense up; like doing a constant body-scan
  3) space: being aware of the room, the corners of it, the space between people, the people (big body), look out and away (not staring or looking down)
  4) interact: see the others, move with them, see/analyze where they are in those qualities, being playful/act
  * reflect now: what's your good/bad? comfort zone, and where not anymore?
  * some qualities might be there, but you are just not aware of them
  * we prefer a sinus-wave like manifestation of those 4 qualities: round, continuous
    * no sharp/unexpected/sudden/abrupt changes in it (spikes in the curve)
    * yet again: you can break this rule if you know what you are doing, using it as a deliberate spice in a safe/controlled way
* ASSISTED GROUND
  * A pushes B down, helping him to be more grounded
  * B is in small dance mode
  * push down on (with both hands): feet, then hips/pelvis, maybe ribs, shoulders, head.
  * only vertically for now, slowly in/out, and symmetrical for now
  * CONT: now asymmetrical; e.g. one head, the other shoulder
    * B needs to compensate to maintain structure upright
    * B needs to rearrange (change (feet) position to stay)
    * be aware of what the body is implicitly doing;
  * CONT: horizontal pressure as well; asymmetric
  * use hands first, then other body parts; transition into free dance
* not done, but also nice:
  * compress different body parts, squeeze them between hands
  * CONTINUATION: start to push horizontal, slowly (cat walk) change positions; imprinting a spiral movement possible
  * lean body against
  * ALSO: do it in trios: two partners use each one hand; then body parts squeezing between; transition free dance
* breathe-sense-ground exercise (same as from previous workshop)
  * first duo; partner dances in negative space, says "3-2-1-pause", then:
    * breathe: relax, soften
    * sense: body scan, detect tonus, awareness
    * ground: release, feel soles of feet
  * CONT: after grounding, push 2 vectors into partner's body to ground more; push into bone stacks, or to spice up also horizontally (spirals maybe)
  * VARIATION in trios: two dance, one rover saying the same thing
    * dancers close eyes, rover touches point on each (only single finger, be precise!) and move from there
* back2back with 50cm distance, tap into small dance, slowly come closer
  * stay in this position for some time, share the small dance
  * slowly transition into free dance while maintaining that quality/sensitivity (unfortunately that "magic" is lost sometimes quickly/easily)
* simple exercise (no dance):
  * with partner, one tells the other to "collapse!", going down super quick (keep head tension for safety), give each other feedback/research
  * CONT: use another command: "yield"; go super slowly to the ground
  * CONT: also upwards (only yield, cant collapse upwards)
* partner negative space rover; gives commands: "pause" + { yield / collapse / push} (can also "halfway collapse")
  * pause implies breathe-sense-ground
* (gaga) tonality exercise: cement - honey - water - air
  * once we did it in duos; this time the whole group all together (teacher giving commands while dancing in quality; then "5...4..." and state new quality)
  * no speed difference is necessary; air can also be slow, not only cement
  * do it even down to the fingers
* rover partner says "pause", then touch 2 points and command A) "move", then do like spiral or B) "tense" and each muscle separately/differentiated
  * connect those two points in whichever direction you want; be precise, take time!
* "rod-chain" (stick-ricebag, yield-tense/superman)
  * 1) from little animal position or 2) from classical hip lift
  * easiest is belly, then sideways, most difficult from back!
* grounding with distraction
  * walking, some decide to do a small dance (determine yourself)
  * eyes closed may be easier, open more difficult (distractions)
  * then walk again on your own will
  * goal: stay grounded while others walk around; keep sensation
* start with partner in very slow dance; pause now and then: be aware of the shared center of mass
  * move/play with it; consciously move it around, change its size
  * be conscious about 4 qualities
* bodywork-like: A lies like starfish, B pulls parts 1) upper leg 2) lower leg 3) foot 4) toes
  * then opposite arm 1) upper arm 2) lower arm 3) hand 4) fingers
  * then other cross-side
  * more proximal more pull strength, at very distal only little force; take time, nice fade-in/out
  * A tries to keep the extension of the body, keeps semi-relaxed, some yielding, but no "against" and no collapsing into it
  * imprint reaching sensation into A
* use lifting positions (little animal, classical hip lift, ...)
  * instead chain-rod exercise, now: reach, exhale, and extend further
  * CONT: spiral; and when land then yield+ground immediately
* roving-choreographer says "3-2-1-pause"
  * give 1 or 2 points; from there extend (to avoid not only from fingers/toes)
  * dancers take time, go slow, experience and research properly (be much in your head = present/conscious/aware/attention/focus)
* do basically the same but in a trio (third roving-choreographer)
  * giving 1 point each, move from there
  * after saying "3-2-1-pause", do the good old (but without it being instructed) breathe-sense-ground
  * difficult to stay connected with partner when starting to extend

* handstand shoulderlift (do it in trios, or even quartetts)
  * 1) prime in warm up movement from the head. head, leading. use eyes. spiral. breathe. move fingers. and: don't bump!
  * 2) start with partner standing behind you, both of his hands on your shoulder blades, giving oomph
    * now walk around together, while partner is always keeping his hands on your back, sliding it (no rolling point of contact) on the back, shoulder blades, lower back, pelvis...
    * walk while leading your movement from the head, your partner still connected.
    * continuation: every now and then, i position myself in gorilla and stop for a moment, inviting partner to jump a bit (using her hands to push into me, a lift to jump)
  * 3) show your handstand abilities.
    * no need to stay long in it, just with straight legs going up, and down. possibly do it against a wall.
    * do not throw your legs, but going down with your arms first, and then controlled handstand.
    * show it to each other. safeguard each other.
    * CAVE: do it "more" one-legged. one goes higher up, and the same goes down again (don't switch mid-air, otherwise partner will "fall into a hole").
  * 4) now me doing quick handstand, partner standing "behind".
    * catching one leg (not both) with open palm (not really grab, just stop it); when i go down with my other leg, partner lets go.
  * 5) now partner catching leg, and follows me with his hand.
    * while doing so, i go towards her, she walks with me (backwards) keeping same distance.
    * either same side hand, then slide to pelvis, and other hand on shoulderblade. or crossed, then slide to shoulder blade, and other find pelvis.
    * i go directly into gorilla, and partner jumps on me quickly.
    * tip: when i stay low, and turn a bit towards her, then it's easier for her to jump.
  * 6) final build up: i go in her direction, she maintains distance, i do a handstand, and when i go down again, i shoulder lift her
     * start first with an "artificial" (if enough strength). slow. without momentum.
     * i need to create a bit of distance so she can jump (controlled, timed, soft).
     * she can stay with one hand on my body, to have a feeling for distance and softer landing.
     * ALTERNATIVE: for those who don't want to do it, either stay being a guardian angel, or stay with the previous exercise
  * this happens when i walk forward, and my partner next to me backwards. i can see that as an invitation to do a handstand and see whether she picks it up (or not). just watch out to kick no one in the face.
* a full 2hrs class (exercises):
  * solo sit, shift weight from butt-cheek to other; hand on ground, scissor legs, feet ALWAYS stay on the ground; when turning right, left leg goes first (also extend with left arm; reach long)
  * do the same lying down, relax the head
  * do full turns now; basically a shrimp+starfish movement
  * do full turns + in little animal up; do it in lanes, both sides (L/R; facing head opposite directions)
  * find partner...
  * first on same spot in room (pre-exercise): little animal positions; inner leg first over on belly, same side hand (as leg over) moves, spiral on the back legs first onto the partner
  * in lanes: both roll (like done before), one goes in little animal, other follow and over (as before)
  * pre-exercise: do the 90 degrees starfish exercise/turn solo on the spot (with teacher-partner)
  * traditional bodysurf
    * WATCH OUT to always cross/be perpendicular, and not parallel (otherwise too much weight on the partner; also risk to put weight on knees/head); either arms or legs, but never both go over at the same time
  * "pick-up: partner exercise:
    * base is rolling "against" (into/towards) the partner with belly or back; then "releases", so flyer is "falling"/"drops" into partner
    * surfer/flyer relaxes head back, articulates spine, let legs softly follow by themselves
    * don't jump! avoid quick, sharp moves as they are potentially dangerous/risky
  * partner A rolling towards B, B putting knee under the "belt area" (belly/lower back); timing is relevant; A rolling over
    * IMPORTANT: keep centers connected! (use chicken legs)
    * then other partner offers "surface below"
    * stay SLOW&CONTROLLED, RELAXED&SOFT
  * continuation: "pick up" technique again, and immediately move "support under" (combining both skills)
    * possibly B helps a bit by using his hand to pull A's center a bit
  * CLASSICAL HIP LIFT:
    * begin with hand sliding diagonally over front of partner
      * it's like "picking up" technique on the floor: taking initiative for a lift as the base, not waiting for the flyer to initiate)
    * get sure to offer enough "side ramps", for going on/off
  * EXERCISE: stand, close eyes; with palm, very quickly go down, and stop very quickly and try to hover 1cm above the ground.
* soft landing:
  * partner is with his ear on the ground (maybe at first hand in between, otherwise too loud); eyes closed
  * other partner(s) walks around, try to walk silently
  * then jumps and land soundless
  * partner on ground says "now" when hears landing
  * goal is that partner never has to say it
* soft lift-off / perfect pouring pelvis:
  * 1 little animal, closed eyes; other on-top (belly/back) and pours without the animal noticing
  * little animal says "now" when it thinks flyer disconnected touch from ground
* EXERCISE: little animal, other person pours his weight on the partner, animal eyes closed and says "now" if they think that flyer not touch ground anymore/take-off (be as soft as when landing after a jump, no hick-up/sharp edges)
  * Why?! in oldschool CI, they still do it (survival mode); but it's dangerous, big impact, requires a lot of skill to "survive", safe yourself.
* floorwork exercises. sit. tabletop. back. belly. ... each find edges. left, right. front, back. and then circle.
* EXERCISE: tell partner "pause" and then { breathe - sense - ground }; take your time in-between the commands so your partner has some space to feel/experience
  * try different orders of those 3 and check the difference/impact
  * observer your partner when you tell him those things; any change visible?!
  * "pause" already breathing happening; with any breathing, already grounding happening; only sensing might be different and solely happening on the inside (nothing visible)
  * ground is relaxing, only downwards, breathe is expanding in all directions/inflating
  * when the position is a strong one (effortfull), lots of tension, which makes it more difficult to ground/breathe/relax
  * do this constantly while you move; of course an asymptotic goal, never to be reached, always aimed for
* EXERCISE: spirals
  * first stand (later walk around)
  * draw circles with your finger(s); change axis/plane; change direction
  * move axis inside the body and out again
  * walk around and turn while drawing your circles
  * increase complexity: inspiring spiral movements; from arms to: spine/torso, pelvis, knees, ...
  * CONT: slow down, make movements larger
    * draw curves (instead of spirals), almost like lines
  * CONT: find a partner
    * follow their curves as if they are "snail traces in space"
    * then catch up with them (not only follow, but take over), and extend the movement, accelerating their spirals
  * LALA land instruction: add spiral not from arms/body, but from space around (arm pits, etc.)
  * motivates visualization skills, seeing those trails in space; like when a camera with long exposure time, lights being moved
  * sliding on them, projecting/extrapolating them
  * esp. in trio, take from A, and "put into" B
  * tap into the qualities, internalize them "magically" (=without much conscious awareness/thought)
* EXERCISE: from spirals workshop
  * lie on back, partner takes head; first just weight, hands on ground; take lots of time, slowly
  * when more than 45 degrees, start to move with (open eyes!)
  * slowly stand up
  * supportive partner enhancing spiral movements, see his pathways
  * one hand on head, other on body
  * 2 phases: 1) give impulses (lead/follow) 2) partner generates spirals himself (self-sufficient/independent)
  * then: join in with your body, manipulate with the box (instead with the hands)
  * great exercise to learn new pathways
  * but: it's an exercise/practice, not "applied CI/dance"
    * not egalitarian, it has a hierarchy, leader/follower; also no sharing weight, not improvised but directed
  * knowledge about anatomy is of use, playing on the edges of possibilities
    * not dislocating a joint, playing safe, but using joints limitations to push into the center
      * head has highest leverage: small push, big impact
* EXERCISE: spirals: with partner, 1 crossed arms, other straight arms
  * touching palms (no grabing, ever!)
  * push quite a lot, for support/stability
  * lifting (search for center) with "y-hands", partner needs to bend wrists, push against, to lift up
  * OPTIONAL: 3rd person (=satellite) seeing spirals in space, and suggesting them, helping duette to embody them
    * without touch, just "draw in space", being like a conductor
    * VARIATION: 3rd person is going to just touch a bit, stroke, draw lines on body to "inject"/extend pathways, giving impulses, actualizing potential spirals
  * don't go on the floor
  * don't over-commit to the hand touch (use as landing gear if needed, don't fall on your nose to maintain hand connection)
  * after a lift, palm-pressure nice to push partner into a spiral
  * satellite is mostly a guardian angel, esp. during lifts; seeing, training eyes
* fun game: after a dance, come up with a movie title fitting the dance, e.g. "kampf der giganten"
* EXERCISE bodysurf:
  *  preparation:
  * one partner rolls/spirals on the ground (in lanes), other holds a body part back; forcing the partner to find a new movement/path(way), solving a puzzle
  * e.g. pulling the hand slightly (don't fight, and let partner rotate within the soft grib), torso, knee, elbow, even head
  * partner tries to leave that pulled part back as long as possible and reach with everything else (keeping the spiral "growing" development of movements)
  * sometimes (as flying partner is already more to the front) necessary to slow down for the base, so center stays connected, so partner can catch up; necessary to push into the ground a bit, to "hit the break"
* EXERCISE: palm-palm pressure, stay connected (can "slide/rotate", they are not glued, but don't grab); some call it "looping"
  * either A) both straight or B) one straight, other crossed
  * through limitation (glueing), we are forced to discover new moves/pathways (creativity); to inspire spirals
- EXERCISE quality practice (fly, levithian, being light):
  - round 1: command to partner to go { up, down }, learn how to relax, surrender
  - round 2: touch a body part and say { up, down } and move from that part
  - round 3: "catch" them mid-air and change direction; or say up a few times, touching different bodyparts
* grounding exercise: with partner, he says ground/tense/yield (don't collapse!) or "claw" (one hand super tensed), and "free"
- EXERCISE: in trios, designated "main focus partner"
  - pouring weight exercise for going up/down: partnered squad with back2back (breathe, look, move)
  - round 1: stand in front of each other, "appropriate" distance, arms away front, palms facing to partner; fall forward, pour weight, catch-stretch; other 2 switch each time; relax the joints
  - round 2: when contact, roll to one side (communicate it non-verbally), push into
  - round 3: include going down/up; advanced: use single/tiny/small point of contact for going down/up; maybe switch/move/roll while going down/up
* EXERCISE: rolling inner point of contact
  * A) standing, partner touches 2 points, you have to connect them
  * B) then from standing to moving/dancing, partner says "pause" and gives points
  * easy: many joints in between
  * difficult (even only intention): both points on 1 (long) bone
    * impossible ones: neck, arm/knee pit
  * feel free to use spirals, to go around, instead of direct lines
  * be precise, be slow!
* EXERCISE: floor point of contact
  * basically the same as before, but now draw a line (like painting) on the ground
  * don't jump points, one continuous line, be precise; have your partner point out hiccups
* EXERCISE: Box RPoC
  * 1) back2back, drawing a square on each other's backs
    * be slow and precise; don't jump points, buldge out a lot
    * esp. during shoulder bladed and lower back
  * 2) draw an X instead (with upper/lower line going horizontally)
    * have 3rd person give corrections and say "reverse" every now and then
    * pay attention to be synchronized when moving; be at the same point at the same time (speed sync; listening required)
* barrel
  * lie on the side, embryo position; and roll over your back to the other side
    * shape of limbs like a barrel (hugging)
    * when starting and landing, be totally relaxed; keep head on the floor
    * requires to have a lot of core strength & stability
  * keep limbs alive, octopus quality, don't tense
    * be even able to talk (and of course breathe) while doing it
  * common hiccups: throw yourself, using momentum (uncontrolled!); or push into the ground
  * more difficult: to slow down; to make the barrel smaller (narrower)
  * partner can say "pause"
  * even more difficult: push lumbal area into the ground, so pelvis lifts up a bit
  * APPLICATION
    * lil animal, over each other parallel
    * variation: standing back2back, double squad down, one pushes hard, other in lil animal
    * go over parallel; tada
    * SAFETY: slide feet on the ground, don't stomp them on the ground, you might break your animal's ankles
* body massage
  * like done in shiatsu
  * roll over your partner (lying on belly); approx. same weight class beneficial but not mandatory (be cautious/precise with amount of weight pouring into partner VS keep with limbs)



GROUNDING
------------------------------------------------
* EXERCISE partnered...
* 1: connect to partner's center only visually; sense it, imitate from afar
  * add imitation: only pelvis movement, not arms or other things
    * also, feel free to "freely reinterpret" a bit, and not be 100% technical correct
      * grasp more the quality of it (also notice when cheating yourself if you cannot do it and want to feel better about yourself ;)
* 2: remote control: first oomph (really strong!); imitate the (pelvis) movement
  * start slow and simple, then challenge each other; do "the clock", rotate/tilt; be clear and clearly differentiate
  * first straight lines, then "closed circles", then free/endless, lastly fast and wild (stay in the proximal zone of development)
  * watch your other hand, is it clinching a fist? try to relax everything
  * as the remote control: pay attention to your partner, what you do and the impact on him.
    * e.g., rotating very fast you'll lose him; not doing just your own thing, but do it together, serve, be with the other person
* 3: without partner: dance freely in space
  * approach someone in negative space - engage with remote control - disengage - repeat
  * no "trains" please: multiple people in a row; quickly detach if someone attaches on you while being attached yourself


PELVIS
=================================================================
* for pelvis mobility: do monty pythons silly walk during warm up
* EXERCISE: show pelvis to your partner. she's touching yours. exploring it.
  * first get consent, what's ok, what isn't. go deep into the bone tissue.
    * follow all the structures of the pelvis on all sides. get an internal visual representation of it.
  * also, choose to completely step out of this exercise (anxiety, intimacy, fear, boundaries).
  * use a fabric, and put it like a diaper, back-front, covering anus and genitals (if wish to do so).
  * maybe also touch your own, then compare it with your partner's
* EXERCISE: draw pelvis on paper
  * 1x (1 page) the anatomically/technical correct one (as much as you can/know)
  * 1x (another A4 paper) a creative/artistic version of your interpretation of a pelvis
    * hand-out paper and pen, put them in a row on the edge of the room
  * after finished drawing, show the "proper solution" and do a group sharing
  * then do a sharing with your partner; reflect
    * what was easy/difficult. how is it now (your understanding of pelvis)? compare with your drawing.
  * also know: where the psoas is connected (L1-L5 and proxi-medial femur); obturator foramen; where the main artery goes through; etc.
* EXERCISE: stand, small dance, feel femur bone
  * explore: try to be one-legged; use muscles instead of structure; play with different positions
  * then go down to the FLOOR:
    * roll on the floor, feel the bone structures and pelvis skeleton (femur, trochanter major, ilium/ischium/pubis, sacrum...)
    * research for 3 highlights, and once done, share it with same partner (as before).
* partner exercise: have your hands around the pelvis bone of your band; stand behind them
  * A: standing
    * 1: ground them first by pushing them down at pelvis bone (typical grounding exercise)
    * 2: they move, you follow their movement (only passive! no manipulation, yet)
    * 3: occasionally send impulses yourself (receive 80%, send 20%)
      * partner decides: go with it or resist it deliberately
  * B: walking together
    * follow partner at first; listen only... let him do freely.
    * then occasionally send counter-impulses; play with saying "no" occasionally; "sumo fighter" mode
    * then partner always has to say "YES" to it (the best way to learn new movement patterns)
      * play with very soft impulses, very light/subtle
  * ADDON: only give touch impulses, let go of constant touch
  * ADDON: use your legs/pelvis/center to manipulate (instead of hands)
* pelvis mobility EXERCISE:
  * walk the cat walk, like models to, exaggerate pelvis swing
  * then extremely isolate the pelvis, no movement in the shoulder
  * then only shoulders
  * then both
  * then none; just regular walking; experience how easy that is
  * CONT: walk next to a person. feel/sense their center
    * engage and disengage with several people; play a bit
    * then touch-contact via shoulders only, walk next to each other for a while
    * then take a 180 degrees turn by using rolling point of contact
* solo EXERCISE: pelvis (girdle) and upper body (shoulder girdle) separation
  * 1: move them freely together
  * 2: one is leading the other (switch)
  * 3: one is moving, the other totally still (switch)
  * put your hand on your lower belly and the other on sternum (switch hand, as we have one dominant)
    * first close your eyes, then move both parts
    * then walk... (find a partner)
* start back2back, shoulder blades have contact, dance there 1 min (give weight)
  * then change contact to pelvises, send impulses (with pelvis/from center) just as we did with hands before
    * A: rotational push (1 side), spiral/turn
    * B: linear push, straight; advanced: wave motion
    * C: combine both (super advanced)
    * + use upper legs to manipulate/"pedipulate" (good balance required)
* pelvis clock advanced exercise: in all 3 planes
  * build-up: do body scan, apply the clock on the floor, and with this sensitivity apply with partner (floor dance)

* EXERCISE: free dance, try to have 30% of the time center2center connection (use no hands!)
  * monitor your own pelvis, pay attention to it
  * also be able to quickly connect to your partner's (when you "sense" it, you know where it is in space, and immediately go for it)
* group EXERCISE: in trios, discuss definition and relations; present group-result to big group; plus discussion
  * define "centering" (similar as did in previous workshop with grounding/yielding)
  * also: how centering relates to grounding
  * => see homework of preparing definitions
* floor EXERCISE/core workout:
  * 1: starfish-shrimp (with partner-teacher); first slow then fast
    * watch out for mistakes: lifting limbs (always on the ground), bending limbs (have them stretched out)
    * CONT: partner gives oomph on lower belly (below belly button)
      * push down while partner on back, and then towards yourself (partner rolling "away side") to give a bit of a counter-push
  * 2: starfish-ball: lie on the back, starfish position; then quickly contract to the smallest ball possible (even with head)
    * do it very fast; also going down again; stop 1 cm before the ground, and then land softly (without any sound!)
    * watch out to do it not too often, as your iliopsoas might hurt quickly (right after, or next day)
    * CONT: partner touches belly, which is the signal to do it; like a heavy ball dropping onto you
* teacher-partnered EXERCISE:
  * build core strength and yet keeping relaxed... soft yet strong; taijiquan iron-wool metaphor
  * doing octopus on the ground; start with 2 commands: UP (hands/feet always off floor), DOWN (hands/feet always touch ground)
  * teachers are the helmet for the partner, so they don't get kicked!
  * CONT: add command PAUSE (freeze for a moment; that partner decides self when to continue)
  * CONT: after pause, add 1 point where partner moves from
  * CONT: now add 2 points
  * tip: observe your partner carefully and touch point where he seems to have a "gap/blind spot"
* TRIO exercise:
  * 1 on the floor lying, 2 are the "standing obstacles"
  * obstacles step around, blocking the path (with firm legs)
  * person on the floor tries to get through obstacles while using the same skill of octopus up/down before
    * don't lift center/pelvis from ground; don't grab; leverage/hooks are ok
  * it's not about "winning" (shows your personality)
    * also not about challenging yourself so much; explore also the easy solutions; experience the full range
* EXERCISE: from starfish, to shrimp, to little animal (and crawl sideways)
  * arm+leg in direction where you want to go, go down first
  * variation: reach into that direction with arm+leg goes into that direction (as if someone would pull you); keep it extended (no shrimp)
  * if there is a little elephant sound here while landing, it will mean danger later on
  * CAVE: in little animal, head always above ass. also now when "going up"/transitioning from lying position.
* EXERCISE body surf:
  * idea for pre-EXERCISE: do the 90 degrees starfish exercise
  * tip for base: push into leg to start roll if partner is on you, otherwise difficult to engage only from core
    * keep periphery always on the ground; as did before
  * CONT: do it in trios: 1 base and 2 surfers (they run behind quickly to make it continuously)
  * how much weight? depends on { partners size/weight/strength }; 40-80% (not nothing, rarely everything)
    * base needs weight for keeping momentum of rolling; to maintain connection
    * when it has to be only 10-30%, always be with your belly on your partner, to be able to take weight off into hands/feet
  * CAVE: fast movement (=heavy weight) on floating ribs is one of the most common injuries in CI
    * prefer to roll over pelvis and lower back; especially pelvis can carry a LOT of weight
  * keep limbs on the ground (also nice to push a bit), as doing the barrel will not give you much/any strength

ACRO YOGA expedition
=================================================================
* typical plane basics (in trio, with guardian angel)
* CONT: 5 people together, 1 guardian above head again, 2 on the sides, those 2 take the arms/wings of the flyer
* "raging acro yoga": base constantly pushes into groan
  * flyer goes "in/over flyer", maybe be pushed sideways by base
  * bit fighting, lots of oomph, a little bit of childlike playful wrestling
  * CAVE: flyer legs not extended (weight goes forward and base has no grip anymore)
    * base not fully extend either (backflip danger)
  * after some time, try to push flyer into a spiral, then go:
    * A) into body surf or B) into little animal, and immediately initial position again



* warm up exercise: "triangulation (triangularity?) of dance"
  * to feel and fill the space (with body+presence)
  * negative (air) vs positive (body, matter) space
  * start to meet other bodies, "grazing"
