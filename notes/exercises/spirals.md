* 2 couples, 1 free dancing
    * try flowy, spirally, round, circle movements; or just be yourself, be authentic
    * the other couple is drawing what they see on a sheet of paper
        * follow a specific body part, the change that part to another
    * possibility for example: upper part of paper draw head, then below shoulder, etc... in segments
* barrel extended:
    * segment lower and upper body, to transition from turn to spiral
    * keep contact on the ground with 1) head 2) shoulder 3) pelvis
* starfish spiral extended
    * start form one body part, partner says "pause", touches another body part, and then continue to initiate the spiral from there
    * start with easy points, then go to more difficult like on bone between joints; use intention as technically not possible to do
* stand, rotate form different body parts
    * have relaxed arms (slapping oneself, like in gigong)
    * 1) solo: learn to differentiate better by leading from different parts: { feet, ankles, knees, hips, chest, shoulders, head }
    * 2) with a partner: he tells you where to move from
    * 3) partner tries to guess from which partner you are moving from
* in lanes: tell partner
    * 1: { up, down, change direction }
    * 2: + kinesphere size changes { small, big }
* sit next to each other, papa bear like, roll over; head down and butt up
    * roll between legs, partner assists with arms/hands to roll over to the other side
    * variation: move over with outer leg first (over partner's further away leg)
        * while doing so, turning, rolling on the belly, the outer arm spirals underneath your own body
        * ending up in a little animal position and then up (or directly into a hip-lift)
* old/known exercise of:
    * partner stands, other touches 2 points, try to connect them with a spiral
        * choose which point start/end, which axis to connect; yes, an axis can be curved
    * start very simple, easy; transition into more challenging ones
        * e.g.: head, very close to each other points (on long bones)
    * sometimes simply work with intention for the impossible ones
* rotate extended arms in counter-directions; start both up, each going in another direction
    * do it with a partner, correct each other
    * CONT: do it while walking, and then also sharp 180 degrees turn
* how to change the direction
    * while drawing a circle on a 2D plane: necessary to go out of the kinesphere, by drawing an eight
        * draw lines in a spherical space without breaking the pathway
    * in 3D space, change -temporarily- the plane
    * instead of using single finger, draw circles/spirals with full hand
* one lies down on the back, partner manipulates the head
    * the receiver uses the manipulation and moves from there. first lying, the mid-level, then stand up
    * switch to holding shoulders, guide hands, etc.
    * give gentle, constant changes/inputs to maintain spiral patterns; it's more like a suggestion
    * CONT: instead of using hand/arms to manipulate, join with the whole body; from time 2 time use hands again to give impulses
    * do it all slowly, and be precise; listen carefully to partner's input
    * CONT: free dance, but give hints/impulses to your partner; free roles now, both can give impulses
        * not only with hand, but with feet, legs, shoulder, ... on different parts, box, arms, head, knees
* stand with partner side-by-side; both have their arms up to "zip" along the side, with lots of oomph-quality
    * one goes straight down to lil animal (inner leg bends, knee down, taking a backwards step)
    * other spirals "away", through the backside, and landing on the side of the lil animal (watch out not falling off the butt)
    * important: keep the centers together (use chicken weg to keep connected if necessary)
* EXERCISE: walk side-by-side, one goes down, little animal, flyer goes over
    * leg first, on back; don't jump as a flyer on the base, use a push of the arms instead and roll slowly over
    * always find balance point, have a check point (see CI wiki for exercise instructional video/description)
* solo: A) arms in "priming spiral" mode, rotating around, left-right, change levels, arms pointing down, mid, and up
    * esp. traversing shoulder level is tricky for many
    * while doing so, also rotate torso/pelvis (movement shows up e.g., when shoulder lifting a flyer)
    * CONT: walk around while doing this
    * CONT: B) draw spirals with fingers on axis outside the body, then move the axis inside the body
    * CONT: combine A+B (plus the "swinging arms" from before)
* shoulder lift:
    * flyer has arm on further partner's away shoulder (other at beginning just freely)
    * base has around back, below flyer's other arm ready to reach under, wide stance
    * base doing a "priming spiral" move (charging the spring)
        * if needed (and possible strength wise) go lower so flyer doesn't have to jump that high
    * flyer stays very close to base's center, rolling "upwards" (defying gravity), staying in (rolling point of) contact
        * kicking over and way back-behind the base's shoulder (do koala before, if you don't feel confident yet)
    * flyer needs to spiral early to land on the side (closer to center line, easier), otherwise on belly (watch out for penis-squeeze)
        * watch out for rolling over flyer's neck (you don't want to break it!)
    * once up, extend abducted legs and arms (here could do a "propeller"); stay for a moment to verify balance
    * flyer can use chicken wing while going down (bend elbow, hand up; no interlocking!!! also not with an extended arm)
    * slide down to the back, base stays in "good gorilla"; stay for a moment, verify balance
    * go down and continue spirals/rolling point of contact (dance integration, less exercise application)
