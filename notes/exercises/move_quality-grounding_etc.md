GROUNDING
========================================================================================================================
* grounding with distraction
  * walking, some decide to do a small dance (determine yourself)
  * eyes closed may be easier, open more difficult (distractions)
  * then walk again on your own will
  * goal: stay grounded while others walk around; keep sensation
* grounding: with partner, he says ground/tense/yield (don't collapse!) or "claw" (one hand super tensed), and "free"
* EXERCISE partnered...
  * 1: connect to partner's center only visually; sense it, imitate from afar
    * add imitation: only pelvis movement, not arms or other things
      * also, feel free to "freely reinterpret" a bit, and not be 100% technical correct
        * grasp more the quality of it (also notice when cheating yourself if you cannot do it and want to feel better about yourself ;)
  * 2: remote control: first oomph (really strong!); imitate the (pelvis) movement
    * start slow and simple, then challenge each other; do "the clock", rotate/tilt; be clear and clearly differentiate
    * first straight lines, then "closed circles", then free/endless, lastly fast and wild (stay in the proximal zone of development)
    * watch your other hand, is it clinching a fist? try to relax everything
    * as the remote control: pay attention to your partner, what you do and the impact on him.
      * e.g., rotating very fast you'll lose him; not doing just your own thing, but do it together, serve, be with the other person
  * 3: without partner: dance freely in space
    * approach someone in negative space - engage with remote control - disengage - repeat
    * no "trains" please: multiple people in a row; quickly detach if someone attaches on you while being attached yourself
* "double the grounding"
  * first start with a small-dance
  * then shift your weight from one to other leg, stay low (prepare to lift + spiral); toes keep touching the ground
  * not metronome like movement ("cutting the ground"), fixed-extended legs (not A shape but U shape, going low)
  * later necessary to walk as a base while partner is on top of you (instead of static lift and not move)
  * lastly add speed, spiral (in all 3 planes), without losing that quality
* ASSISTED GROUND
  * A pushes B down, helping him to be more grounded
  * B is in small dance mode
  * push down on (with both hands): feet, then hips/pelvis, maybe ribs, shoulders, head.
  * only vertically for now, slowly in/out, and symmetrical for now
  * CONT: now asymmetrical; e.g. one head, the other shoulder
    * B needs to compensate to maintain structure upright
    * B needs to rearrange (change (feet) position to stay)
    * be aware of what the body is implicitly doing;
  * CONT: horizontal pressure as well; asymmetric
  * use hands first, then other body parts; transition into free dance
* not done, but also nice:
  * compress different body parts, squeeze them between hands
  * CONTINUATION: start to push horizontal, slowly (cat walk) change positions; imprinting a spiral movement possible
  * lean body against
  * ALSO: do it in trios: two partners use each one hand; then body parts squeezing between; transition free dance
* common structure used in CI: feather/boulder exericse (use the power of imagery)
  * half class imagine feather or boulder; other walks around trying to pick them up
  * boulder: drop center, move it away from partner, making heavier
  * feather: raise center, close to partner's core, making lighter
* Push and Drop (multiple centers)
  * partners in front of each other; one is pushing on one shoulder, then suddenly moves away
  * that shoulder goes forward, occupying "hole in space", while other shoulder moves backwards, compensating/counter-balancing; spirals


FLOATING
========================================================================================================================
* partner holds arms in, you push sideways open as hard as possible for about 20 seconds
  * then let arms float up "by themselves" => that's the floating quality we are looking for; remember this sensation during the float-dance (being light)
* A moves freestyle, B says "pause - breathe - sense", and then touch 1/2 body parts, and A floats from those
* in trio, C is dancing close in negative space; says "pause" A+B close eyes, and C touches each one point, from where the move/float from
  * when couple dances, the 3rd is a "rover", not just standing there, almost like "being in their aura", very close-by; being part of it, not just stand there, arms crossed
  * use this quality also during the "warm-up walking", or on the dance floor; secretly dance with everyone (and enjoy the feeling of belonging, not feeling lonely in a group, but being with everyone)
* EXERCISE: front2back, person standing behind lifts partner, wrap arms around his belly
  * 1) partner is neutral 2) partner is floating (light, easy) 3) partner is grounded (heavy, some kgs heavier felt)
  * then let your partner guess in which state you were



MISC
========================================================================================================================
* let your partner move freely, and sometimes say "pause" to pause them, and then say "breathe, ground, sense"
    * after a few seconds, when they did and felt did, they continue on their own again
    * add on: tell them additionally "slow/fast/up/down" and pause them
* OBSERVE yourself, 4 qualities
  1) breathe: deep, conscious, don't hold it
  2) sense: your muscle tonality, e.g. when you are unbalanced, usually tense up; like doing a constant body-scan
  3) space: being aware of the room, the corners of it, the space between people, the people (big body), look out and away (not staring or looking down)
  4) interact: see the others, move with them, see/analyze where they are in those qualities, being playful/act
  * reflect now: what's your good/bad? comfort zone, and where not anymore?
  * some qualities might be there, but you are just not aware of them
  * we prefer a sinus-wave like manifestation of those 4 qualities: round, continuous
    * no sharp/unexpected/sudden/abrupt changes in it (spikes in the curve)
    * yet again: you can break this rule if you know what you are doing, using it as a deliberate spice in a safe/controlled way
* breathe-sense-ground exercise (same as from previous workshop)
  * first duo; partner dances in negative space, says "3-2-1-pause", then:
    * breathe: relax, soften
    * sense: body scan, detect tonus, awareness
    * ground: release, feel soles of feet
  * CONT: after grounding, push 2 vectors into partner's body to ground more; push into bone stacks, or to spice up also horizontally (spirals maybe)
  * VARIATION in trios: two dance, one rover saying the same thing
    * dancers close eyes, rover touches point on each (only single finger, be precise!) and move from there
* partner negative space rover; gives commands: "pause" + { yield / collapse / push} (can also "halfway collapse")
  * pause implies breathe-sense-ground
* tell partner "pause" and then { breathe - sense - ground }
  * take your time in-between the commands so your partner has some space to feel/experience
  * try different orders of those 3 and check the difference/impact
  * observer your partner when you tell him those things; any change visible?!
  * "pause" already breathing happening; with any breathing, already grounding happening; only sensing might be different and solely happening on the inside (nothing visible)
  * ground is relaxing, only downwards, breathe is expanding in all directions/inflating
  * when the position is a strong one (effortfull), lots of tension, which makes it more difficult to ground/breathe/relax
  * do this constantly while you move; of course an asymptotic goal, never to be reached, always aimed for
- quality practice (fly, levithian, being light):
  - round 1: command to partner to go { up, down }, learn how to relax, surrender
  - round 2: touch a body part and say { up, down } and move from that part
  - round 3: "catch" them mid-air and change direction; or say up a few times, touching different bodyparts
* simple exercise (no dance):
  * with partner, one tells the other to "collapse!", going down super quick (keep head tension for safety), give each other feedback/research
  * CONT: use another command: "yield"; go super slowly to the ground
  * CONT: also upwards (only yield, cant collapse upwards)
* (gaga) tonality exercise: cement - honey - water - air
  * once we did it in duos; this time the whole group all together (teacher giving commands while dancing in quality; then "5...4..." and state new quality)
  * no speed difference is necessary; air can also be slow, not only cement
  * do it even down to the fingers
* roving-choreographer says "3-2-1-pause"
  * give 1 or 2 points; from there extend (to avoid not only from fingers/toes)
  * dancers take time, go slow, experience and research properly (be much in your head = present/conscious/aware/attention/focus)
