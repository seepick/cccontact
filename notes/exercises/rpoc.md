* rolling inner point of contact
    * A) standing, partner touches 2 points, you have to connect them
    * B) then from standing to moving/dancing, partner says "pause" and gives points
    * easy: many joints in between
    * difficult (even only intention): both points on 1 (long) bone
        * impossible ones: neck, arm/knee pit
    * feel free to use spirals, to go around, instead of direct lines
    * be precise, be slow!
* floor point of contact
    * basically the same as before, but now draw a line (like painting) on the ground
    * don't jump points, one continuous line, be precise; have your partner point out hiccups
* Box RPoC
    * 1) back2back, drawing a square on each other's backs
        * be slow and precise; don't jump points, buldge out a lot
        * esp. during shoulder bladed and lower back
    * 2) draw an X instead (with upper/lower line going horizontally)
        * have 3rd person give corrections and say "reverse" every now and then
        * pay attention to be synchronized when moving; be at the same point at the same time (speed sync; listening required)
* partner touches 2 points, and you connect those (decide which one is starting and end point; A & B)
    * now imagine (use visualization) a line connecting those 2 points, and move through them (wave=simple, spiral=advanced)
    * add-on: do the same (touch 2 points), but now start with one point on the ground and roll on the floor to the other point
        * no jumping point of contact! imagine you are painting your body by touching the ground (some body parts are impossible; neck, armpit, knee pit); sometimes you need to be very creative/exploratory, rotating your limbs and "weird" positions to get there
    * it's all about learning bulging out every part of your body, to later on stay in (rolling point of) contact
