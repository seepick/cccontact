* EXERCISE: hip lift (trio)
    * 1: guardian angle pushes flyer on hip bone (ilium) to spiral down; flyer extends leg, reaching, use core muscles
    * 2: then base is pushing with the own hand the flyer "open"
    * 3: flyer does himself and with help of the base, moving his pelvis, but using no hand
    * 4: lastly, flyer is doing just by himself, with little/no help from base
    * if flyer is too much weight towards the head, it will be impossible to "climb the mountain"
    * short break... teacher sharing insights to the group, mistakes he observed, giving advice how to improve (solutions+cheats)
    * lift partner again and now continue making steps (less static/exercise-like)
        * lower your partner, stay connected (principles!), and lift again, continuously
* reversed hip swing-lift
    * similar to as standing side-by-side (facing opposite) lift, but now not hug belly front but from the back
    * stand not entirely next to each other, but a bit in front/back, so landing on pelvis will be easier
    * pull partner, flyer's outer leg, and do it continuously both
