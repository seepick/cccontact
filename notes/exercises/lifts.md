* EXERCISE: hip lift (trio)
    * 1: guardian angle pushes flyer on hip bone (ilium) to spiral down; flyer extends leg, reaching, use core muscles
    * 2: then base is pushing with the own hand the flyer "open"
    * 3: flyer does himself and with help of the base, moving his pelvis, but using no hand
    * 4: lastly, flyer is doing just by himself, with little/no help from base
    * if flyer is too much weight towards the head, it will be impossible to "climb the mountain"
    * short break... teacher sharing insights to the group, mistakes he observed, giving advice how to improve (solutions+cheats)
    * lift partner again and now continue making steps (less static/exercise-like)
        * lower your partner, stay connected (principles!), and lift again, continuously
* reversed hip swing-lift
    * similar to as standing side-by-side (facing opposite) lift, but now not hug belly front but from the back
    * stand not entirely next to each other, but a bit in front/back, so landing on pelvis will be easier
    * pull partner, flyer's outer leg, and do it continuously both
*  simple hip-lifts
  * front2back: flyer use chicken wing wrap around shoulder (lateral direction); base use hand on partner's upper leg to stabilize
  * back2back: first base goes down, head between scapula; then bend forwards and scoop (consider size difference!)
  * front2back diagonal: one moves upper body right, other left, and side-ways hip-lift
  * classical hip-lift: backend of base on flyer's chest, step in (same side leg)
    * move pelvis into your partner; flyer is leaning as a plank forward into (don't hinge from your pelvis; see acro-yoga)
    * other base's hand is doing a snap sound (hand other side as body moves) and arm stretched to indicate direction of flyer
    * offer a valley, by rotating your pelvis, look to the flyer
    * arms are guarding: hover one arm above the leg (offer as leverage, don't manipulate too much, don't grab), other arm below chest
* ADVANCED hip lift: side2side, opposite direction facing
  * embrace (hug) partner's pelvis bone (not too high), base moves pelvis forward and sideways, to be underneath flyer's (both try to find center-matching for on-balance position)
  * flyer leans backwards when invited, both have their safety "seat belts" on; flyer is back-bent (scary! breathe)
  * flyer spirals down; base tries to do steps to keep moving, and supports flyer to go down (slight manipulation/support)
  * CAVE: release arm early enough, otherwise it might dislocate
* KOALA lift technique: stay close to the partner and aim high! base goes down a bit, helps up, use chicken wing+leg
  * building on top of koala: shoulder lift: be able to kick (use "healthy amount" of momentum)
    * when going down, use a spiral movement
* handstand shoulderlift (do it in trios, or even quartetts)
  * 1) prime in warm up movement from the head. head, leading. use eyes. spiral. breathe. move fingers. and: don't bump!
  * 2) start with partner standing behind you, both of his hands on your shoulder blades, giving oomph
    * now walk around together, while partner is always keeping his hands on your back, sliding it (no rolling point of contact) on the back, shoulder blades, lower back, pelvis...
    * walk while leading your movement from the head, your partner still connected.
    * continuation: every now and then, i position myself in gorilla and stop for a moment, inviting partner to jump a bit (using her hands to push into me, a lift to jump)
  * 3) show your handstand abilities.
    * no need to stay long in it, just with straight legs going up, and down. possibly do it against a wall.
    * do not throw your legs, but going down with your arms first, and then controlled handstand.
    * show it to each other. safeguard each other.
    * CAVE: do it "more" one-legged. one goes higher up, and the same goes down again (don't switch mid-air, otherwise partner will "fall into a hole").
  * 4) now me doing quick handstand, partner standing "behind".
    * catching one leg (not both) with open palm (not really grab, just stop it); when i go down with my other leg, partner lets go.
  * 5) now partner catching leg, and follows me with his hand.
    * while doing so, i go towards her, she walks with me (backwards) keeping same distance.
    * either same side hand, then slide to pelvis, and other hand on shoulderblade. or crossed, then slide to shoulder blade, and other find pelvis.
    * i go directly into gorilla, and partner jumps on me quickly.
    * tip: when i stay low, and turn a bit towards her, then it's easier for her to jump.
  * 6) final build up: i go in her direction, she maintains distance, i do a handstand, and when i go down again, i shoulder lift her
     * start first with an "artificial" (if enough strength). slow. without momentum.
     * i need to create a bit of distance so she can jump (controlled, timed, soft).
     * she can stay with one hand on my body, to have a feeling for distance and softer landing.
     * ALTERNATIVE: for those who don't want to do it, either stay being a guardian angel, or stay with the previous exercise
  * this happens when i walk forward, and my partner next to me backwards. i can see that as an invitation to do a handstand and see whether she picks it up (or not). just watch out to kick no one in the face.
* EXERCISE SEQUENCE: typical hip lift + handstand (inner leg first; base is helping so flyer is rotated open a bit; watch out proper hand position) + shoulder lift
* EXERCISE: back-lift + handstand: hugging each other sideways (opp. direction facing), one lifts partner back, other makes handstand and flip forwards (away from base)
* CLASSICAL HIP LIFT:
  * begin with hand sliding diagonally over front of partner
    * it's like "picking up" technique on the floor: taking initiative for a lift as the base, not waiting for the flyer to initiate)
  * get sure to offer enough "side ramps", for going on/off
