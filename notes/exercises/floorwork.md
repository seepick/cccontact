LEVEL TRANSITION
=======================================================
* start standing back2back, going down and up via squad
  * CONT: back2back walk in one direction, one partner goes down, other free falls while extending arms
    * from LITTLE ANIMAL, one person to the side, other on top, and stand up again (watch out that first upper body upright, and then go upwards)
    * pay attention to not lose the connection (back, lower and upper, and even head)



MISC
=======================================================
* BODYSURF
  * start sitting back2back; legs bent (can push)
  * one partner reaches stretched arms up and to one side, going onto his belly
  * other partner goes over, from other side, with his back on the lying partner (stay on the back, no spiral, otherwise no continuation easily possible; in this exercise)
  * important: base is chicken-wing hooking the upper partner to ensure the centers are connected
  * also helps with the flyer, when he "drops", to use this as leverage to get up, ending into seated position again.
* bodysurf:
    * preparation:
    * one partner rolls/spirals on the ground (in lanes), other holds a body part back; forcing the partner to find a new movement/path(way), solving a puzzle
    * e.g. pulling the hand slightly (don't fight, and let partner rotate within the soft grib), torso, knee, elbow, even head
    * partner tries to leave that pulled part back as long as possible and reach with everything else (keeping the spiral "growing" development of movements)
    * sometimes (as flying partner is already more to the front) necessary to slow down for the base, so center stays connected, so partner can catch up; necessary to push into the ground a bit, to "hit the break"
* sit side2side, both spread legs; one partner rolls over between other's legs, reaching arm between first; then is upside down (weird/funny position, butt towards other's chest). stay very close to center (don't put weight on legs, painful); stay slow & controlled. sitting partner helps rolling partner with arms to roll over. also possible with 3 people (2 people back2back and 1 "roller")
* floorwork
    * 1) lie on ground, starfish to shrimp (L/R) movement, and banana in-between; do it fast/slow
    * 2) barrel: lie sideways, roll other side, both arms/legs different "range", do it with pause (partner says); most difficult: close/open range; common mistake to push yourself from a limb, no! contract your limbs towards the center
    * 3) combine both, starfish and barrel; start with one or the other; or: barrel but with octopus free limbs
* SPIRAL: on the ground, lying, do: 1) on-ground octopus 2) off-ground octopus (and keep limbs alive!) 3) banana
* bodywork-like: A lies like starfish, B pulls parts 1) upper leg 2) lower leg 3) foot 4) toes
    * then opposite arm 1) upper arm 2) lower arm 3) hand 4) fingers
    * then other cross-side
    * more proximal more pull strength, at very distal only little force; take time, nice fade-in/out
    * A tries to keep the extension of the body, keeps semi-relaxed, some yielding, but no "against" and no collapsing into it
    * imprint reaching sensation into A
* floorwork exercises. sit. tabletop. back. belly. ... each find edges. left, right. front, back. and then circle.
* body massage
  * like done in shiatsu
  * roll over your partner (lying on belly); approx. same weight class beneficial but not mandatory (be cautious/precise with amount of weight pouring into partner VS keep with limbs)
* RELAXATION: mama+baby bear (plus bit back massage), change roles, rolling around, transition into (floor) dance, surrender and keep centers connected
* a full 2hrs class (exercises):
  * solo sit, shift weight from butt-cheek to other; hand on ground, scissor legs, feet ALWAYS stay on the ground; when turning right, left leg goes first (also extend with left arm; reach long)
  * do the same lying down, relax the head
  * do full turns now; basically a shrimp+starfish movement
  * do full turns + in little animal up; do it in lanes, both sides (L/R; facing head opposite directions)
  * find partner...
  * first on same spot in room (pre-exercise): little animal positions; inner leg first over on belly, same side hand (as leg over) moves, spiral on the back legs first onto the partner
  * in lanes: both roll (like done before), one goes in little animal, other follow and over (as before)
  * pre-exercise: do the 90 degrees starfish exercise/turn solo on the spot (with teacher-partner)
  * traditional bodysurf
    * WATCH OUT to always cross/be perpendicular, and not parallel (otherwise too much weight on the partner; also risk to put weight on knees/head); either arms or legs, but never both go over at the same time
  * "pick-up: partner exercise:
    * base is rolling "against" (into/towards) the partner with belly or back; then "releases", so flyer is "falling"/"drops" into partner
    * surfer/flyer relaxes head back, articulates spine, let legs softly follow by themselves
    * don't jump! avoid quick, sharp moves as they are potentially dangerous/risky
  * partner A rolling towards B, B putting knee under the "belt area" (belly/lower back); timing is relevant; A rolling over
    * IMPORTANT: keep centers connected! (use chicken legs)
    * then other partner offers "surface below"
    * stay SLOW&CONTROLLED, RELAXED&SOFT
  * continuation: "pick up" technique again, and immediately move "support under" (combining both skills)
    * possibly B helps a bit by using his hand to pull A's center a bit
