* head-/handstand
  * flyer just balance on your partner; 1) on your belly 2) on back
  * 1: try to go on with headstand; 2: then off (or handstand)
  * do the typical aikido roll continuation
  * animal cross over with headstand: land with "superman pose" ;)
* starting by body surfing, and then base moves into little animal
    * lying next to each other, base one leg bent, flyer reaching over with straight leg
        * easier if future-flyer is sitting up (hands to the back), more difficult if lying down
    * PLUS: flyer lying on belly (instead of back), with spiral will then be on back flying
    * RESEARCH question: as base, the "front-side" arm-leg, should it be bent (as do in the "dry practice") or extended (as I'd do)?
* find trio, go into little animals (or monkeys, bear position walking)
    * one person "jumps softly" on other animals, with legs first (both at the same time; otherwise it's just climbing)
    * experiment maybe with: spirals, going over 2 animals, ...
* "rod-chain" (stick-ricebag, yield-tense/superman)
  * 1) from little animal position or 2) from classical hip lift
  * easiest is belly, then sideways, most difficult from back!
* SPIRAL: little animal: the other person "crossed-starfish"-technique over
  * either arm/leg first, either same-side/over ending
* little animal, other person pours his weight on the partner, animal eyes closed and says "now" if they think that flyer not touch ground anymore/take-off (be as soft as when landing after a jump, no hick-up/sharp edges)
  * soft lift-off / perfect pouring pelvis:
    * 1 little animal, closed eyes; other on-top (belly/back) and pours without the animal noticing
    * little animal says "now" when it thinks flyer disconnected touch from ground
  * Why?! in oldschool CI, they still do it (survival mode); but it's dangerous, big impact, requires a lot of skill to "survive", safe yourself.
* barrel
  * lie on the side, embryo position; and roll over your back to the other side
    * shape of limbs like a barrel (hugging)
    * when starting and landing, be totally relaxed; keep head on the floor
    * requires to have a lot of core strength & stability
  * keep limbs alive, octopus quality, don't tense
    * be even able to talk (and of course breathe) while doing it
  * common hiccups: throw yourself, using momentum (uncontrolled!); or push into the ground
  * more difficult: to slow down; to make the barrel smaller (narrower)
  * partner can say "pause"
  * even more difficult: push lumbal area into the ground, so pelvis lifts up a bit
  * APPLICATION
    * lil animal, over each other parallel
    * variation: standing back2back, double squad down, one pushes hard, other in lil animal
    * go over parallel; tada
    * SAFETY: slide feet on the ground, don't stomp them on the ground, you might break your animal's ankles
* KNEELING SPIRAL:
  * from knee sitting, other partner is standing on the side, pelvis&shoulders connect
  * from knee sitting into little animal, other partner goes with (sharing weight, yet sliding point of contact)
  * and then A) fingers pointing away (easier) or B) towards the partner (more difficult)
  * roll over partner, maybe with a small kick, make sure center-on-center (balanced; have a pause, break, verify you are stable, thus having all the options available again)
  * go down on same or other side. stay in contact! don't lose oomph quality!
  * for the base: you move, lower, support, push where needed.
* rolls: alone, animal, standing
  * 1) aikido roll; in lanes on the ground
  * 2) on little animal (continuous, like did with yvette): in trios, guardian angel, saying "over" or "under"
  * 3) standing: more difficult&dangerous, only for advanced
