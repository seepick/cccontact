* head-/handstand
    * flyer just balance on your partner; 1) on your belly 2) on back
    * 1: try to go on with headstand; 2: then off (or handstand)
    * do the typical aikido roll continuation
* animal cross over with headstand: land with "superman pose" ;)
* Plus-EXERCISE: starting by body surfing, and then base moves into little animal
    * lying next to each other, base one leg bent, flyer reaching over with straight leg
        * easier if future-flyer is sitting up (hands to the back), more difficult if lying down
    * PLUS: flyer lying on belly (instead of back), with spiral will then be on back flying
    * RESEARCH question: as base, the "front-side" arm-leg, should it be bent (as do in the "dry practice") or extended (as I'd do)?
* find trio, go into little animals (or monkeys, bear position walking)
    * one person "jumps softly" on other animals, with legs first (both at the same time; otherwise it's just climbing)
    * experiment maybe with: spirals, going over 2 animals, ...
