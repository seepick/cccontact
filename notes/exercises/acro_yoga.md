* typical plane basics (in trio, with guardian angel)
* CONT: 5 people together, 1 guardian above head again, 2 on the sides, those 2 take the arms/wings of the flyer
* "raging acro yoga": base constantly pushes into groan
    * flyer goes "in/over flyer", maybe be pushed sideways by base
    * bit fighting, lots of oomph, a little bit of childlike playful wrestling
    * CAVE: flyer legs not extended (weight goes forward and base has no grip anymore)
        * base not fully extend either (backflip danger)
    * after some time, try to push flyer into a spiral, then go:
        * A) into body surf or B) into little animal, and immediately initial position again
