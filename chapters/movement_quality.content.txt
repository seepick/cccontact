ABOUT this (new) chapter
==================================================================
* not the observable itself, the physical
* more the internal, intention, attention, attitude/mindset/mentality, approach, how we engage, visualization


CONTENT
==================================================================
* what to do with habits? we try to improvise, choose to move in new ways
  * passions; desire to be somewhere else, someplace specific
  * non-conscious mind does all this calculating
* meditation practice: examining the body space for 3 days; roaming systematically, 1-point of view, analogous to vision
  * try to do with 2 points; works best if they are symmetrical
  * then try to do whole body at once
  * consciousness: a tendency to focus
* the finer units of time we perceive, the smaller the containers of consciousness we can experience
  * by being slower than our normal thought/action, giving mind time to step out of habitual/practical relations to events
  * consciousness can be formed/reformed; its parameters will adjust to conditions and conditioning
* what is my body doing when i am not conscious of it?
  * to answer it, means to be conscious about it, thus impossible
  * not just physiological inquiry, but appraisal (=judge its value) of different states of consciousness, accompany different activities
  * a frontal attack on the unconscious
  * trying to catch myself behaving unconsciously, ruined by turning on my consciousness to it
  * spying on myself, self-hacking
* intimacy is (more) about intention, not so much about observable, physical behavior
* it's good to be in your head! don't be mistaken; 1) but don't ruminate, but contemplate. don't think in circles, unproductive thoughts, but think in lines, constructive. 2) don't get distracted, thinking about groceries, but keep your thoughts focused on what's going on right now 3) even the inner critic is welcome, complaining that you are not doing the very first moment perfectly, although you have never done it before, and it is rather unrealistic that anyone on earth would be able to do so, but you of course have the expectation on yourself that you do! listen to that voice, acknowledge it, let it motivate to do it better, use it as a friend, rather try to silence it as an enemy; he means good, but is sometimes a bit over to top, calm him down, by compassion/kindness/empathy. (to resist is to persist)
* anticipation of your own, and especially partners trajectory (during an improvised, non-predictable way of moving). jedi knight skill, trained during walking (quickly) through crowds, not bumping, allowing the subconsciousness to do the calculations, mapping physical objects (people/bodies) as vectors in a 2D plane. psychologically grounding and thus physically being more grounded (breathe in, hold breath, going up, arms up, get tensed; vs: breathe out, deep breath, stay or even lower center of gravity, spiral away/on spot). during dancing (especially with a trio+), we do the same, whether unconsciously or in rare occasion also consciously. we try to predict based on the current momentum and pathway where our partner(s) will be, and try to be there for them, to support and guide. to enable what's not possible just by oneself, to create a feeling of doing it together, in connection. building trust, safety, predictability. holding each other. taking care, by paying/giving attention
* a pause, stillness, silence... in a conversation, we often feel awkward. how comes? in dance, the same. a reset, emptiness, from where anything is possible again. like mindfulness and the clarity of the glass of water; so too the mind, and the body; let it sink.
* sometimes develop a "fuck it" attitude. Seriously, develop an attitude of caring less, considering we all started to dance to feel pleasure, and not struggle and stress ourselves out to be good. It will help you to relax, to soften, and thus things will work actually even better. Just enjoy the dance.
* research mode: feels less enjoyable, more bumpy, experimental (who doesn't fall/fail, does something wrong; no growth, just staying in comfort zone, being cool, showing-off)
    * also less dancing with the partner, less focused on the dance itself, but more on the research topic
    * ego disclaimer useful: tell your partner that it will be worse that what usually capable of
* yi moves -> qi moves -> body; touch it (with intention), there will be attention, there's the you (the self)
    * the touch increases awareness to that specific body part; use it in an exercise: touch your own bodypart (e.g. pelvis) and move along while touching
* difference: suggesting VS manipulating
    * suggesting: maintain agency of the partner, still can say yes/no
        * can be still a very strong push (useful for extra-ordinary moves/techniques, requiring the base of my partner)
    * manipulating: i force myself on him, grabbing his hand, wrap around/cover fully, no other choice
        * not bad per se, but preferably only with people you know well; some get triggered by it; can be a refreshing spice and open up totally new possibilities; can be very enjoyable too
* when focusing on a specific research topic, let go of the idea of being good; dare to fuck it up, it's research, not performance;
    * "if you don't fall, you're doing it wrong", because you are playing in the comfort zone, where you can show off, pretend to be good, flawless, perfect; but it won't lead to growth, you will get stuck
    * allow yourself to fail, to fall; let go of your own expectation what you usually can do (yes, you are good enough; so now that you have that validation, can you please move on and research?!), and play/work with what is
    * stop trying to impress/please your partner
* observe your own tendencies: slow/fast, safe/risky, male/female, low/high, ... try to expand and explore both ends of the continuum for each dimension, to have (more) choice and grow
* have an active research mindset; when exploring a topic/exercise (labbing?), put some active effort in it, think and analyze (constructively; be in your head, as much as possible, but in a good/serving way); BUT: don't let it block you, but guide you. "thinking, a good slave, but a bad master".
    * research mode: staying aware with the exercise AND with the dance/with your partner, can be difficult. OPTIONAL: if you dance in a trio, with the third being the rover (satellite), pay attention to 1) the partner/dance 2) the exercise/research-topic 3) the rover (super difficult shared attention skill)
* attitudes: playful, curiosity, care, responsibility
* movement quality: expand/fold alias flexion/extension (going down fold, going up expand).
* the advantage of going slow. more input/details, safer. if can do slow, also fast (but not other way round).
* if you are too tensed, make "brrrr"-sound with lips to relax, keep the breath active
* "being in your head" = disproportional amount of thought, non-constructive cognitive effort
  * also: overly self-critical inner voice, based on self-doubt and insecurity (fear of failing)
    * yet, being critical itself is useful, even towards oneself, as it helps to get better, pointing out things, being integer (live up to one's own expectations)
  * in opposition to "purely sensing with open awareness, free of judgments"

Why Trust Is Worth It
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWypWe9UAhQ

Trust is a confusing thing. It seems so simple, but when you try to pin it down, it can be elusive.
I think of the way that my body sits on a surface that's new to me, unknown. And how my muscles remain tight, anticipating anything, and I'm constantly aware of that surface. Over time, with familiarity, I can relax and start to lean back.

For many of us, that initial tension exists so much of the time. We expend so much energy watching, and calculating, trying to predict, reading signals in people, ready for anything to change suddenly. Preparing to be disappointed. So much energy spent.

We talk about trust as something you build, as if it is a structure or a thing, but in that building there seems to be something about letting go. And what it affords us is a luxury. It allows us to stop thinking. To stop worrying that someone won't catch us if we fall, to stop constantly scanning for inconsistencies, to stop wondering how other people act when they are not in our presence. It allows us to relax a part of our minds, so that we can focus on what's in front of us. And that's why it's such a tragedy when it's broken.
A betrayal can make you think of all the other betrayals that are waiting for you in things you haven’t thought of, in people you rely on. And you can feel yourself tightening up - bracing. And in the worst cases, you might resolve to trust no one.
But, that doesn’t really work.
Trust is your relationship to the unknown, what you can’t control. And you can’t control everything. And it's not all or none. It's a slow and steady practice of learning about the capacity of the world. And it's worth it. To keep trying. And it's not easy.

Some say that trust is like a fork, not one way, but many ways. Physical, emotional, and maybe something else. I almost imagine trust as these invisible hands that we stretch out into the world, looking for someone to hold on to as we walk into the unknown future.

So who do you trust? And how can you grow it?

========================================================================================
* advantages/disadvantages of qualities/dimension:
  * e.g. speed: fast/slow... TODO continue enumeration with pros/cons of each
* flow VS speed
  * flow: principles, basics, quality, deep, profound, subtleties
  * speed: techniques, superficial, easily impressive, shiny, simple entertainment

* the way we talk is the way we dance, both an expression of personality; personality:
    * "sturm und drang" of the young; calmness of the older
    * stable traits, yet with age (periods of life), they change within the same person; thus: how stable is it really?
* many people are afraid of depth, of intimacy, of deep intimacy
    * going slow, feeling and connecting with each other
    * going fast is a way to avoid that quality; running (away)
    * fast makes us not feel what's happening; unaware, safe, comfortable
* play with dimensions, deliberately explore the edges of:
    * slow-fast, follow-lead, soft-hard (push), relaxed-tensed, ...
    * check how your partner responses (pay attention, be full on with perception), what works, what doesn't
