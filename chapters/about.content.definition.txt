* complementary disciplines/styles to CI:
    * for deep body awareness feldenkrais
    * for strength, control and precision pilates
    * for floorwork/handstand some movement/animal flow/locomotion classes (at “movement amsterdam”, or “crazy monkey”)
    * for flow and integrated, soft yet controlled bodymovemeents gaga and contemporary improvisation
    * partner acrobatics for the fancy stuff (dangerous!)
    * aikido, jujitsu, judo, ... for rolling and practical understanding of anatomy/bio-mechanics (joints)
* "CI archetypes" section (list pros and cons of each of them)
  * the ecstatic dance hippie (overly wobbly, smells funny and fancy clothes)
  * the acrobat (fast, technical, dangerous)
  * the dancer (very accentuated, more decoration than substance)
  * the sexy hunter (male or female; little clothes, overly sensual)
  * the rock (insensitive muscle guy lifting everyone, especially small women)
* more professional dancers are good in being light/fast/lots of decoration/show off performance
  * they lack substance/depth: sensitivity/grounding/slowness/center-connection
* essential of CI (part of its definition)
    * being improvised, empty mind, not wanting, let it happen in the moment
    * BUT: we anticipate 0.5 seconds ahead
    * difference aware at the moment ahead VS forcing my plans other(s)
* neijia, the internal martial arts (incl. russian systema): experts in sensitivity to incoming force, and yielding to it; very soft...
- what is it? art-sport, sport-art?
- what is art? a form of expression (also whatever a human says is art, is art)
	* a choreography thus is not art, as it leaves little to no room space for individual expression
	* the more principle based, and the less technique based, the more it becomes an art (more freedom/space/interpretation/decision/choice)
	* if to every question, there is a clear rule which is the right answer (A-B, C-D), it becomes more mechanical, predictable, and less of an art
- what is dance? must be more narrow than a moving body; maybe music?
	* CI has sometimes no music. and is not performance, not aesthetics driven; nor is it primarily/soley focused on joy/pleasure/fun, like people doing it in clubs ("shaking")
