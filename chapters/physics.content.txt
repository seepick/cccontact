* time, as internal sensation of movement; "the chronosphere"; the space of time (or: time of space)
  * different from vision, light only reveals see-able exterior
  * chronosphere reveals the transparency of everything
    * thus, duality of interior/exterior irrelevant
* when two bodies meet, center of mass is shared between the two units; becoming one unit (in a way, relative to gravity)
  * as long as involved in leaning/giving weight, changing weight/orientation, relative to each other, they have one shared operative center
* still not sure: gravitons? which particle makes gravity? a field? physics not yet sure...
* ad physics: a vector is { direction + magnitude } (that magnitude can be force, or anything else)
* write more about gravity in physics (counter intuitive reality; unknown quantum realm, gravitrons?)
* combine this: how movement and gravitational pull relates
* ad physics: pressure measured in newton (i think 10N = 1kg?)
* awareness of other people around you, like in supermarket/walking in crowded places:
  * we (usually unconsciously) compute vectors, predict paths; too much for the brain to do it consciously
  * that's what we call the jedi-skill, like it is "happening to me"; trust it, let go, and pass control to unconscious brain part
* birth, an abrupt change, different factors than those in the womb, and there is gravity
* gravity, a natural force... our conscious memories of negotiations with gravity start rather later (5 years)
* the globe of perception, we are each the center
* oddly missing in our pantheons: the god of gravity
* gravity allows us to measure, a steady force
    * imposes regularity on things we notice
* 3-body problem; a swing; chaos, unpredictable (like the weather); with 2, it's possible to predict, like 0.5secs before, easy, safe, even risky stuff is safe; but with 3 (a trio) it becomes impossible
* spirals, waves, center of mass/gravity, force, kinetics, angular momentum, ...
* we don't jump on a base, never, rude!
  * instead we pour our weight, or even better: we "melt" it.
* ad physics: explain angulation
* ad physics: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wave-motion/
* many esoteric-metaphysical-magical "energy" approaches are not easy to understand, their explanations mystical
    * and that's exactly what makes them so attractive
    * they seem advanced (because complicated/not understandable)
    * they serve some romantic-human need (like most superstitions do)
* talking about lines and points:
    * the theoretical (geometrical/mathematical) realm is an abstraction of reality, not reality itself
    * any concept, such as metaphysical "energies" and other superstitions are likewise
    * don't confuse the finger (which is pointing to the moon) with the moon, don't climb up the sign and claim to have been there
    * don't confuse money with wealth, and the word with meaning
    * we don't move in lines, there are no points connected; practical/useful to say, yet not real
* ad physics: the difference between power/energy/force seems not really clear. same as CoG/CoM, maybe shared center as well...
