* still not sure: gravitons? which particle makes gravity? a field? physics not yet sure...
* ad physics: a vector is { direction + magnitude } (that magnitude can be force, or anything else)
* write more about gravity in physics (counter intuitive reality; unknown quantum realm, gravitrons?)
* combine this: how movement and gravitational pull relates
* ad physics: pressure measured in newton (i think 10N = 1kg?)
* awareness of other people around you, like in supermarket/walking in crowded places:
  * we (usually unconsciously) compute vectors, predict paths; too much for the brain to do it consciously
  * that's what we call the jedi-skill, like it is "happening to me"; trust it, let go, and pass control to unconscious brain part
* birth, an abrupt change, different factors than those in the womb, and there is gravity
* gravity, a natural force... our conscious memories of negotiations with gravity start rather later (5 years)
* the globe of perception, we are each the center
* oddly missing in our pantheons: the god of gravity
* gravity allows us to measure, a steady force
    * imposes regularity on things we notice
