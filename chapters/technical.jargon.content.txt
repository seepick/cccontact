* roles during practice:
  * rover (also "satellite"): dancing around in negative space, no physical contact (touch), but dance with, being engaged
  * (semi-)conductor: giving instructions what to do, to either single other person or a duo; zone of proximal development (learning zone, not comfort/panic zone)
* terms/glossary: under-dancer, over-dancer
* define/explain what's a "score" (a task; from dance world; more fuzzy, less specifically
instructive); nancy starks "underscore"
* "to lab"
* define: negative space (kinesphere), (butterfly-)touch, contact
* ad jargon, animals: dead fish (arm), not collapsed
* find new (animal)names for "rod-chain", and "super(wo)man"
* vocabulary:
    * pouring: slowly/mindfully transferring weight into another physical object (partner/floor). if it would be fast, we would "throw" our weight.
    * yielding: relaxation of muscle tension, usually into gravitation pull (but also other external forces, e.g. push of another person), usually towards the ground (gravitational direction).
    * collapsing: complete, sudden relaxation of muscles, losing structure, without control (no reversability; usually not desired but sometimes can be used as a spice); similar with pouring VS throwing, is yielding VS collapsing
    * center VS core: center=point of gravitational center, below naval (spiritual systems refer also "energetic center"), for women slightly lower (pelvis-shoulder sex difference); core-everything which is connected to the spin, from pubic bone to lower ribs, abs and back, sides/obliques.
* under/overdancer is superset of base/flyer
* NEGATIVE SPACE: regular "space", free space, opposite of positive space (occupied by body/person); VS kinesphere
* LITTLE ELEPHANT: sound when landing/stepping; indicates tension, no control (falling), unsafe/risky...
  * for soundless landing: relax, be sensitive, proper technique (shifting)
* "semi-choreographer": the partner who is giving command; when dancing with in negative space, also a "rover/satellite"
ad definitions:
- formal/lexical ... typically found in dictionaries; clear/concise explanation general understanding
- operational ... the process/criteria used to measure/identify it
- ostensive ... pointing out examples; preferrably concrete physical objects
- synonyms ... provide a list of similar terms which overlap, to (hopefully) be able to infer its meaning
- genus-differentia ... put the term in a broader category (genus), and specifying characteristics (differentia) that makes it different from siblings of this group
- precising ... reduce vagueness by introducing more specific meaning
- theoretica... define within framework/theory, including assumptions/premises
- negative... stating what it's not; clarify boundaries (useful when concept is abstract/ambigous)
* narrative ... using a story/description/scenario (lived experiences), where the meaning unfolds naturally, to give richer understanding/emotional resonance, to connect on a personal/experiential level, through empathy/relatability
* imaginary ... using a fictional explanation (metaphor/fantasy, poetry/symbolic), more creative and visual, less accurate, to spark interest and painting a memorable image, illustrating an abstract concept.
* when we use "lala land words" like "the energy" (and we don't refer to the physically defined term), we do so due to a lack of better word
  * "mean it seriously, but not literally"; it's like a tool
  * like a nice story (christmas) or a movie: we enjoy watching it, without confusing it to be real (like a theater, someone dies, and we don't call the police)
* skinesphere (add to glossary): like kinesphere (from laban's "space harmony"), but the skin surrounding the body
  * used for "grazing", a way in CI to say hello
* ad jargon: butterfly touch
