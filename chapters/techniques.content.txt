CONTENT
==========================================================================================
* metaphor: it's like building a house; we sometimes fancy those amazing windows, that roof, that ceiling, the decoration, painting and facade... it looks great (from the outside). but we have not yet invested enough to build a proper basement, a foundation where the building can rest on. it turns out to be unstable, and almost collapse... the same with any skill, dance, or CI specifically. beginners are eager, and it's good wanting to learn, but be honest, be patient, and invest where it is most needed (and not just looks or feels good; feeding the ego, the inner child). without grounding (are any other basic principle), the lifts and more fancy techniques will have no substance. it will be not elegant, effortful, maybe even risky. you might do movements which resemble CI from the outside, but actually has nothing to do with it, as the principle/the essence is not adhered. to ground, to share weight, to have a connection, to be soft, agile, listening/syncing... a lifetime of practice. techniques are quick to learn, but have no substance.
* don't try to find too eagerly possibilities to lift! let it happen, and if it doesn't, don't try to use it, because the moment will be immediately be gone (with lots of force, we can, yet not smart to do so; also breaks the flow/continuity)
* head up or down? (lead with eyes)
    * down, to surrender during floor work; to melt, to "nest"; breathe out while doing so to increase relaxation, yield/ground, soften, flow/adapt
    * up (in direction of trajectory/movement + eyes), direct, focus, engage, lift, fly, light/feather, upwards
* for hiplift, the clock is needed. pelvis flexibility. e.g. not only scooping, but lowering one side as a ramp. first sense, seek, connect centers (dont jump). much can be cheated (chicken leg/wing), base can compensate.
* nesting a la raul. fill the space. cuddle in; esp. floorwork.
* giving air (raul), finding bridges. basically give away weight while partner aligns.
* move eyes, moves head, moves spine, moves everything else.
* LITTLE ANIMAL:
  * is very alive, helps with, being active (we are never passive, more receptive/reactive); not like table-top position (static)
    * giving oomph, make arrival/landing easy by lowering parts ("runway")
    * making a "saddle" (hollow back, like when lifting, not arching it; concave/convex)
  * when going on little animal position, do exercise: "raging bull"
    * RAGING BULL can also stand up, lock is strong enough of flyer
* give your base TIME to find his structure (raul's air and bridge approach)
  * too early => he will collapse!
  * how to know (when it's the right time)? => simply look with eyes; when feel strong (unyielding) resistance; when in doubt, better wait too long than too short
  * as a base, take space, have a wide posture/stance (not too narrow)
* motto "SOFT/smart FEET make no sound": when walking/landing (no little elephants)
* TRI-POD: the foot can be separated in 3 parts (two front, one back); helps to get more grounding
  * EXERCISE: 1) just intention to move without moving 2) actually shift weight after intention initiated 3) move arm (first one, then both) 4) move them sharply, faster 5) do all but on one leg
* ad TECHNIQUES:
  * a spice is a spice; not too much, otherwise tastes bad. not too many different ones, otherwise tastes disgusting. technicals/lifts, just a bit now and then
  * beginners are impressed, intermediates are obsessed, the advanced look for the subtleties in the connection instead
  * they are spices, and as such, they ruin the soup if used too much
  * lifts are great, fun, challenging, but what we should look instead for is the depth in the basics, the principles, and the interaction with the partner
    * less about how to add even more and more complex technical "hoopedipoop"
  * lifts are good for the ego, good to show off and good for the judges while performing in school or a competition
    * but to nurture the soul, we must go slower, go deeper, listen carefully, and see the little wonders within
  * as a teacher, i'd say: "don't show me all the fancy moves you can do, show me your basics, that makes me smile and appreciate watching you"
* when flying, reaching/superman OR relax/hang?
  * both can have their own pros/cons
  * reach: usually preferred, more active/engaged. lighter. easier to spiral and move.
  * relax: feels like heavy rice bag (grounding; vs levithian); being soft is more adaptable though, flexible, ready to embrace the moment, what's happening, surprise, improvisation
  * challenge then maybe: best of both worlds, to be active, yet open for surprises.
* the difference between a "good jump" and a "bad jump"
  * it's mostly about timing. that we find each other softly mid-air, and no bump/clash landing.
  * not for beginners, maybe not for intermediate (unsafe, lack of skill, too quick), advanced with care.
  * be humble when doing it. regulate your enthusiasm/adrenaline to stay in a safe zone.
  * always know where your partner is: does he have the constitution/strength and skill to lift you? don't surprise. have danced with him already. and don't do it out of surprise but super announced.
* AD LIFTS: get sure when going down, one has to change direction (usually/easier for the base)
* when spiraling down from a lift, often we lead from the foot/toe, but try to lead from the pinky finger; will result in more extended (reaching) body posture, maybe it might feel even a bit more scary...
* the lift is not initiated by the flyer, but invited by the base.
  * not a forced action, but an open question (can be said yes or no to it)
  * not as in "i invite you to stand up", which is using fake-polite language, it's usually a command hiding itself behind a nice facade (wolf sheep fur)
  * when basing a lift, we invite/offer, and the flyer decides ultimately to accept it (or not; rejection feelings?!)
  * we don't "force them" by grabing them (acrobatics?! martial arts throw?!); it's disrespectful, takes away autonomy
  * yet, as with every rule; motto: "you can do whatever you want as long as you know what you are doing"; if you are advanced; know your partner very well; if it's a deliberate choice (and not an accident)
* being slow = sense more, but harder to get momentum
  * beginners need momentum to catch a spiral, speed helps to compensate for hiccups; advanced can also do it slowly
  * spirals are usually making you go faster
    * esp. extended limbs, increase angular momentum/distance from center
* SPIRALS
  * differentiate initiation: not only fingers VS toes, but also whether FRONT vs BACK
    * moving one side forward, or the other backwards
    * might feel a bit like more about intention than actual movement
  * getting dizzy (or even nauseous):
    * solution is to slow down, to change direction, or to focus on a point (like ballet people are doing)
    * good news: it will get better over time doing it more often you do it, like a muscle
  spirals contain turns in their center
      * a turn is "usually" in one plane only
      * spirals can change/combine multiple planes
      * thus: a spiral can change levels (going up/down) a turn is usually mono-directed (in horizontal plane)
* speed of turn: linear/static; speed of spiral: accelerated/dynamic
- lifts = like cherry on top of a cake, like a spice/salt: don't overdo it, or it will turn bad (respect the break even point)
* the use of sounds; evolutionary: a scream = a warning; communication
  * also: an expression of joy (weeeeeee)
  * often deliberately used for tension release (sounding = exhale)

* floor work is very advanced, even more than little animal and standing lifts!
    * focus on maintaining center connection (use chicken legs/wings)
    * keeping pathway continuation
    * requires lots of core strength (yet soft, relaxed)
    * being aware of people around you (safety)
    * way more intimate, need to feel comfortable with it
* floor work exercises often lead to bruises (esp. at the hip bones). that's ok, it will go away.
    * motto: "blue bones are ok, broken bones are not"
* little animal: hollow back, we call "saddle" (no mountain)
    * also don't bend the back too much, as it will strain your back muscles
* modes of doing an exercise:
    * 1: research: serious, depth, progress, focus, development, curiosity, growth, mastery
    * 2: play: fun, enjoyment, happy, light, smile, pleasure, hedonistic, win-win
    * 3: fight: competition, eagerness, motivation, against/counter, proving, showing-off, reassurance/validation, win-lose
* flyer's mistakes:
    * flyer jumping on base, instead of pouring weight; base shall not feel the "lift-off" (can also practice going on little animal)
    * flyer is bending legs, making an "iron ball"; super heavy for base; it's a fear reaction, extend/relax
    * flyer is overly contracted, "closing" muscles, tensing up, stop breathing, shiver (like with TRE exercise); usually men
* base's mistakes:
    * bad VS good gorilla:
        * 1: base having head below ass; flyer will fall down forward => head above ass
        * 2: base having an arched back (yoga cat)
            * flyer will not be able to have a surface where he can balance; fall down backwards => do a hollow back (yoga cow)
    * base is bending his pelvis forward, disconnecting instead of staying connected; sharing weight throughout
    * don't be a static/dead animal/base, but be alive/active:
        * lower your pelvis, bring her down, closer to the ground; otherwise flyer drops on the floor (little elephant)
        * create a "ramp", and lower one side of the pelvis (see clock exercise)
* find together the right amount of going down/up to find center
    * base doesn't go down too far, bend knees too much, unnecessary, most have not enough strength to get up again.
    * flyer shouldn't need to go on the toes (only if the height difference huge, and the base lacks strength to go low)
* when doing a partnered exercise, don't just "do something" but clearly think about it (and observe) what and why you do it what you do
    * where are the weak spots of your partner, and give stimulation there
    * don't just go wild and crazy, but pay attention to whether your partner is still following (zone of proximal development)
* technique "travelling": walking together through the room, being connected with the partner while doing so, negotiate how/where to move

* the purpose of walking-warm up
    * fire up attention, waking up, walking up, warming up
    * jedi skills training: becoming more aware of the unconscious processing of others as vectors on a plane
        * keeping track of pathways/positions; trust the computing power within and act upon it (gut feeling/intuition)
    * keep moving continuously without a break; spiral down/up/around if necessary; don't stop/freeze; also a psychological thing (breathe)
    * soft (smart) feet, no sound (little elephants), relax (like in quadrupedalism, landing softly with "smart hands", reaching fingers)
    * body scan: include whole body while moving with octopus quality; soft, all-encompassing
    * connect with others (look, smile), and the space/room (feeling home, arriving)


* Spiral is one of the key aspects in CI and in movement in general
    * it can be found in any living being – from our double helix DNA, to the galaxy's shape, to our patterns, movement’s formation and structural building
    * to harness this structure, to better understand it and to build with it a stronger, more fluid way of movement
    * discover new hidden pathways that lay dormant in our body, that once opens will transform our dance into higher levels
    * Spirals are one of the strongest movement forms in our body, and it allows us to grow from the center outward and from the ground up
    * Spirals are the way upward from the ground into the sky – so let's Spiral our way to heaven

SPIRALS - THEORETICAL - GEOMETRICAL
- math: a curve emanating from a point; moving further away as it revolves around the point
- 2D/plane spiral: a curve on a plane that winds around a fixed center point at a continuously increasing/decreasing distance from the point
    - easily described with polar coordinates
- 3D/space spiral: a curve that turns around an axis at a constant/continuously varying distance while moving parallel to the axis; a helix
    - e.g.: conical spirals (triangle), spherical spirals (ball), toroidal spirals; double-twisted helix (a spiral wound around a helix)
- different types:
    - Archimedean spiral: like a nautilus shall on 2D
    - Helix: like staircase or ramps for bikes/cars
    - Conical spiral: like a pyramide but circular and spiraling
- helix (pl. helices) is a shape like a cylindrical coil spring or the thread of a machine screw
    * a type of smooth space curve with tangent lines at a constant angle to a fixed axis
    * see DNA molecule (two intertwined helices)
    * Greek word: "twisted, curved"
    * a "filled-in" helix (for example, a "spiral" (helical) ramp) is a surface called a helicoid ("helical surface")
        - helicoid:
            - a smooth surface embedded in three-dimensional space
            - traced by an infinite line that is simultaneously being rotated and lifted along its fixed axis of rotation
            - => see: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Helicoid.svg
    * a conic spiral/helix: a spiral on a conic surface, distance to apex an exponential function of the angle indicating a direction from the axis
    * see helix composed of two sinus curves: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix#/media/File:Rising_circular.gif
- a subtype of whorled patterns: a group also including concentric objects
    - whorl = whirling, coiling; curl, swirl (wirbel); arising from a single point (on an axis)
        - a whorl is spiral patterns occurring in plants/animals (e.g., sunflower head)
        - a whorl is also called the spiral pattern of fingerprints
    - an individual circle/oval/volution, in a whorled pattern; consisting of a spiral / multiple concentric objects
    - examples:
        * like leaves or branches, radiating from a single point
        * the whorl of a fingerprint (central papillary ridges turn through at least one complete circle)
        * hair whorl: patch of hair growing in circular direction around a visible center point (head, beard, chest)

    - "golden spiral" using the golden ratio of 1:1.618 as a growth factor
    - 137.5 degrees is the golden angle, related to the golden ratio
    - also: fractal pattern; fibonacci spiral
---------------------------------------------
SPIRALS - PHILOSOPHICAL TECHNICAL
* if we narrow the word spiral in the context of movement, it still needs to be defined whether we talk about:
    * a (funnel like) shape, as in:
        * sitting down, arms close to the shoulders, slowly standing up in a rotational manner
        * slowly spreading the arms further away, like a helicopter (=helix, but moving along the axis), increasing distance _r_
    * some development of kinetic force (spring quality)
    * some higher level of abstraction for a movement pattern
* spiral movement (actually helix) is an emergent property, from a reductionist point of view, there's only rotation (anatomically seen)
    * just like that, there is "actually" no push or pull movement, but only contraction of muscle fibers
        * there is no god, no state, no company, no money,... imagined realities
        * there is no wetness or heat, it's also just an emergent property (if you look close, you won't find it)
        * consciousness as an emergent property?!
    * if a spiral is a delay of rotation in segmented parts, then a stiff (solid, inanimate object) can't spiral but only rotate
        * if we zoom in closely, there are no solid objects
            * as in the atomar level, there will always be a delay; thus everything spirals (everything is wobbly)
        * going further, we could argue there are no distinct objects... and we are down the rabbit hole ;)
    * what can be considered as a fact depends on the level of magnification; before discussing, it needs to be agreed which level we are talking about
        * like the story with the elefant and the blind people...
        * for us humans, to talk in human practical terms, we should preferably by default assume the human perception of reality
            * although just an abstraction/illusion, yet the one we all share and live in
    * it's like classical mechanics is still a useful tool
        * like language is, words, constructs, abstractions of but not reality itself
        * although quantum mechanics invalidated it
            * the distortion of the quantum realm can be neglected to still yield useful results of classical mechanics
* having that said:
    * the lowest useful level of magnification to go would be molecular level:
        * muscle contraction (myosin-actin interaction and the sliding filament theory)
    * based on that, there are, due to biomechanics (muscles, tendons, joints working together),
        * the basic movements of our body/anatomy:
            * flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, internal/external rotation, elevation/depression, protraction/retraction, ...
    * based on that, more complex movement patterns can emerge, such as spirals
---------------------------------------------
ANATOMY, BIO-MECHANICS, PHYSICS
- myofascial chains; working as a unit; according to our anatomy, they are arranged in spirals
- physics: rotation, angular momentum, ...
- "spiral lines" on the body: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPpdR1r9k7E
    - crossed 2x: 1) between shoulder blades and 2) at the naval
    - the left spiral line includes the right shoulder and rib cage and then to left hip and leg, around heel and up again to head (and vice versa
    - from head, over splenii muscles, to rhomboids (through medial-border of scapula; a reciprocal relation) to the serratus interior
- (oblique = diagonal)
---------------------------------------------
PRACTICAL - MOVEMENT
- cross-lateral necessary; diagonals
- rotation (initiated by center, moving as a whole; vs. from externals/limbs/fingers/toes, sequential)
- geometric shape; polymorph like "wave-particle thing": from side a rectangle, from top a circle
- "carving space"
- transverse spiraling: a change in 3 unequal spatial pulls
    - spatial pull: invisible line of inherent power (potential energy)
    - can be revealed in movement (crystalline forms, like icosahedron, provide a roadmap for spatial pulls)
* we can spiral inwards (towards the center) or outwards (expansion)
* different axis possible:
    * also: single VS multiple at the same time
    * whereas a spiral is a movement in all three planes; if only 1 plane, that it isn't a spiral
* coordination of complex movement patterns (like multiple spirals in different axis throughout the whole body):
    * too much which needs to be comprehended consciously intellectually anymore
        * we need to rely (backoff) on images (that's why flowery language is used)
        * easier to use the body/move with an image, than anatomical precise instructions
---------------------------------------------
PERSONAL - ASSOCIATIONS
* rectangle-circle duality (like "wave–particle duality") of spirals:
    * from the side, it looks like a rectangle, from the top like a circle
    * tantric wisdom states:
        * if we look "from the top" on our behavior, it seems like we are going in circles, doing the same mistakes over and over again
        * but looking from the side, there is actually change (hopefully improvements) happening
        * doing the same mistakes, yes, but with less impact, more mindful, with shorter delays in getting back awareness at the moment
    * spiral symbol for spiritual purification:
        * christianity: neo-platonist symbol for prayer/contemplation, circling around a subject and ascending at the same time
        * buddhism: symbol for a gradual process on the path to enlightenment
        * while a helix is repetitive, a spiral expands and thus epitomizes growth - conceptually ad infinitum
* in math as an alternative coordinate system (cartesian vs. polar)
* common "spiral objects":
    * a spring (a helix though, not a spiral)
    * "spiral" for contraception
    * a funnel (getting smaller and smaller, faster and faster in a circle-like line)
    * a shell (nautilus, snail)
    * a screw; a simple rotation, yet also moving downwards; drilling into; or other mechanical gears
    * stairs (wendeltreppe); fire escapes outside of buildings in movies
    * a (metal) spring to allow its expanding force
    * phone cable (back in the good old days, stationary landline phones)
    * the tail of some lizard-like animals
    * galaxies (discs)
    * the edges of a notebook
* in cartoons, when eyes are replaced with spiral objects to indicate that they are dizzy/hypnotized
    * when wanting to hypnotize someone, they have to look at a rotating spiral pattern (kaa, jungle book)
---------------------------------------------
PERSONAL - MY SURROUNDINGS
* a biro, it uses a spring to "push out"; similar to the mechanism of a (pin tumbler) lock (key pushing pins in vertical shafts)
* a sink, like a funnel, water moving in spiral shape (drain spin); and no, direction independent of hemisphere ;)
* my hair (beard and chest) has a spiral pattern :)
* mental sensations (thoughts and emotions) can have a "spiral nature"
    * as such that it has almost an irresistible gravitational pull down towards its center
---------------------------------------------
PERSONAL - MY MOVEMENT
* we don't spiral the arm, we are rotating it (no change towards/away from the center)
* usually, the body's center line is used as the axis, and arms/hands as the force initiator
* use of centrifugal force: throwing arm peripherally away to spin the center (ice-skater like)
* used to get up/down to preserve kinetic energy (momentum); more efficient
    * instead of using a straight line (simply going up/down) with more effort
    * see Feldenkrais sit-stand spiral transition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-xG60F_qVg
* locally in hand, leading with fingers, rotating in wrist; drawing a spiral with constant distance to axis
---------------------------------------------
TAIJIQUAN / MARTIAL ARTS
* taijiquan/qigong/neijia/martial arts all about it; using how muscles are built; using kinetic principle to deflect incoming force
* rotation of a punch when hitting, but also defensive deflective techniques
* same as we propagate throwing baseball in a full body spiral; also using fajing quality
* see spirals of chen taiji: https://practicalmethod.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3-27-2014-1-31-09-PM.jpg
    * going throw major joints; spiral structures allow us to return incoming force outward
        * like drill bits extracting material upward as drill inward
    * "to withdraw is to issue" (issue=push out)
    * everything is rotation! (no up/down, left/right, in/out); see silk-reeling exercise
* taiji uses "contained spiral force"
    * instead of bare "momentum" as so many do, which can easily be overcome; the weak overcoming the strong
    * it's like a tire spinning in the air, while on its axis of the car (you touch it, you burn yourself)
        * compared to when it is rolling on its own on the ground (you touch it, you can stop it slowly)
    * that's how the force in taiji is contained
* a spiral in taiji is a rotation on the body while another part of the body stretches it
---------------------------------------------
DURING CLASS
* define (and describe how it looks): spiral, turn
    * where does a spiral start from/end? can it form the center/axis?
* a turn is linear, a spiral circular
    * turn has a fixed point, clear direction
    * spiral is spinning infinitely
* turn: rotation as a whole; spiral: sequential rotation
* drawing: a spiral on 2D plane; looking from the side, like a pyramide (also upside down)
    * a helix: just a circle in 2D, but from the side it's a rectangle
* a spiral has to do with elasticity (like a vortex, you spin a cross, when it's elastic, it will bend quicker closer to center, and later on the outside)
* a car turns, but doesn't spiral; a basic change of the direction
* turn: has no initiation point, all points move at the same time (practically speaking)
* spiral: starts from initiation point, and grows with a delay towards the end
    * a spiral has a delay; subsequent rotations of the joints; like a wave traveling through the body
* turn: homolateral, spiral: contra (cross) lateral (crossing axis/some plane)
---------------------------------------------
SPIRALS
* the complementary pattern/force to spirals are waves. different, simpler.
    * even "better": to combine both of them at the same time
* be aware of axis (and planes)
* walking is a primed spiral (like a spring force); not a complex spiral, and we "break it" when we walk, left/right motion
* being able to see A) weight B) center C) spirals; know where to put weight (architecture)
    * being able to anticipate the next movement; safer, better (requires pathway continuation)
* priming spirals (vs continuous spirals): abruptly stopping it, changing the direction
    * when we walk, we prime spirals; when we lift as a base
    * like charging a spring (quality): down, charge up, release, up (explosively)
* pathway continuation possibilities expand when spirals can shift in planes
    * when first going into one direction (plane) spiraling, and then wanting to change the direction into other
    * smooth transition by overlapping into another plane (turning it for a moment into a more complex spiral pattern)
    * also possible to change the body parts leading
    * if it stays a simple spiral, then it feels boring and can get stuck
* when changing the direction and maintain pathway: use a different plane, choose a body part, incorporate spirals
* magnetization: an alternate pattern to rolling point of contact
    * it allows new spiral pathways if used correctly
    * magnetize the backs, attached to each other; find a common axis between both bodies and pivot around it
    * stop and change the direction of spirals, enables new possibilities; e.g., to lift back-to-back
* recursive patterns (at the same time, co-existing)
    * like in telecommunication, a carrier wave containing multiple streams of information on different frequencies
    * same with body "waves", or spirals in that case
    * theoretically infinite recursions are possible, infinitely combinable, yet practically already two recursions are challenging/complex to execute
    * try maintaining one big spiral, while adding another "into it" at a different frequency (or plane for that matter)
* let the spiral-momentum guide/dictate the pathway. not interfering with "wanting" (thus muscular force)
* verify it's working (application/applied test): with partner, stay in connection (!) while changing the direction (also do it fast, and be precise)
* priming spirals: charging a spring. using kinetic energy, stored in one direction, and (explosively/rapidly) released in the other
---------------------------------------------

* head movement: can be a nice spice, but don't do it constantly
    * enhanced if first led by the eyes, and when reaching also with the fingers "beyond"
    * think of rotations/spirals: if eyes/head stay static, the rest of the body won't follow
    * try a back-flip while the chin is to the chest -impossible!

* in some exercises, to make it easier, have a dedicated leader-follower role
* to dare to push into your partner, don't be afraid to be rude or anything like it; it allows many new different possibilities
    * it can actually feel very comfortable/supportive, to be pushed, to be lead/dominated, even the head (know with whom though!)
* some of the more difficult moves (acrobatics) require not only technical skill, but also (lots of functional) strength and especially balance
* learning by observation; a lot is possible
* another under-emphasized skill: to be a support at the right moment; to anticipate/predict, to be there and push into
* much of skill is "hidden" if there is mistrust, fear... maybe caused within the person itself, maybe interpersonally caused
* precision in movement = high resolution body awareness
    * being fast lowers resolution; thus going and more details will be revealed (also the hiccups we like to cover up)
* new techniques learned at the beginning feel very mechanical, edgy, "straight lines", separated, artificial...
    * they are not yet embodied so that they can naturally flow into the dance
    * e.g.: a hip-lift, while standing, up, down, and then only start to move again, instead of continuously moving
* in strong positions (when scared?) engaging the core is crucial, yet breathing often stops with it
    * solution: use the "pilates breath", you might not like it at first, but it has its use:
        * inflate the chest, keeping the belly tight (no belly breathing), abs contracted
    * dedicate some time to deliberately practice and pay attention to the breathing styles
    * esp. in effortful moves/movements, or in scary ones anyway to keep on breathing
        * secondary which technique being used as long as keep on breathing to regulate nervous system/fear response/emotions
