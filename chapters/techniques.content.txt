ABOUT:
=> rename from "techniques" to "technical"
* not listing of exericses => see wiki
* more talk about it generally; universal advice to improve every/any technique
* how to learn/practice, its importance/relevance; how to relate

CONTENT:
* metaphor: it's like building a house; we sometimes fancy those amazing windows, that roof, that ceiling, the decoration, painting and facade... it looks great (from the outside). but we have not yet invested enough to build a proper basement, a foundation where the building can rest on. it turns out to be unstable, and almost collapse... the same with any skill, dance, or CI specifically. beginners are eager, and it's good wanting to learn, but be honest, be patient, and invest where it is most needed (and not just looks or feels good; feeding the ego, the inner child). without grounding (are any other basic principle), the lifts and more fancy techniques will have no substance. it will be not elegant, effortful, maybe even risky. you might do movements which resemble CI from the outside, but actually has nothing to do with it, as the principle/the essence is not adhered. to ground, to share weight, to have a connection, to be soft, agile, listening/syncing... a lifetime of practice. techniques are quick to learn, but have no substance.
* don't try to find too eagerly possibilities to lift! let it happen, and if it doesn't, don't try to use it, because the moment will be immediately be gone (with lots of force, we can, yet not smart to do so; also breaks the flow/continuity)
* head up or down? (lead with eyes)
    * down, to surrender during floor work; to melt, to "nest"; breathe out while doing so to increase relaxation, yield/ground, soften, flow/adapt
    * up (in direction of trajectory/movement + eyes), direct, focus, engage, lift, fly, light/feather, upwards
* for hiplift, the clock is needed. pelvis flexibility. e.g. not only scooping, but lowering one side as a ramp. first sense, seek, connect centers (dont jump). much can be cheated (chicken leg/wing), base can compensate.
* nesting a la raul. fill the space. cuddle in; esp. floorwork.
* giving air (raul), finding bridges. basically give away weight while partner aligns.
* move eyes, moves head, moves spine, moves everything else.
* LITTLE ANIMAL:
  * is very alive, helps with, being active (we are never passive, more receptive/reactive); not like table-top position (static)
    * giving oomph, make arrival/landing easy by lowering parts ("runway")
    * making a "saddle" (hollow back, like when lifting, not arching it; concave/convex)
  * when going on little animal position, do exercise: "raging bull"
    * RAGING BULL can also stand up, lock is strong enough of flyer
* give your base TIME to find his structure (raul's air and bridge approach)
  * too early => he will collapse!
  * how to know (when it's the right time)? => simply look with eyes; when feel strong (unyielding) resistance; when in doubt, better wait too long than too short
  * as a base, take space, have a wide posture/stance (not too narrow)
* motto "SOFT/smart FEET make no sound": when walking/landing (no little elephants)
* TRI-POD: the foot can be separated in 3 parts (two front, one back); helps to get more grounding
  * EXERCISE: 1) just intention to move without moving 2) actually shift weight after intention initiated 3) move arm (first one, then both) 4) move them sharply, faster 5) do all but on one leg
* ad TECHNIQUES:
  * a spice is a spice; not too much, otherwise tastes bad. not too many different ones, otherwise tastes disgusting. technicals/lifts, just a bit now and then
  * beginners are impressed, intermediates are obsessed, the advanced look for the subtleties in the connection instead
  * they are spices, and as such, they ruin the soup if used too much
  * lifts are great, fun, challenging, but what we should look instead for is the depth in the basics, the principles, and the interaction with the partner
    * less about how to add even more and more complex technical "hoopedipoop"
  * lifts are good for the ego, good to show off and good for the judges while performing in school or a competition
    * but to nurture the soul, we must go slower, go deeper, listen carefully, and see the little wonders within
  * as a teacher, i'd say: "don't show me all the fancy moves you can do, show me your basics, that makes me smile and appreciate watching you"
