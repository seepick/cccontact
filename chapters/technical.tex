Techniques is what makes most of the people feel \textbf{impressed}.
Think of a child visiting a circus, watching the acrobats doing their tricks.
We will quickly explore the role of techniques (versus principles), and \textbf{conceptually} introduce them.
Most prominantly of course are \textbf{lifts}, the signature move of CI\@.
This is not meant to be a full listing with detailed descriptions of specific techniques.
For that, you want to visit the complementary website of this book.

\section{Small Dance}\label{sec:small-dance}

Recognizing and listening to the \gls{smalldance} is a starting exercise helping the practitioner to increase his \textbf{body awareness}.
It is usually done standing --and at the beginning, this was the only of doing it--, as it is the strongest way to balance due to the small surface.
Which position to take is not as important as the perception of reaction to the \textbf{process of balance}, which is always happening --except when completely lying down--, in any position.
Ultimately, you want to be able to figure out your own and also your partner's center, as lifts and basically, everything starts happening from there.

It could be considered as a form of \textbf{mindfulness} practice, where we focus our full attention to the sensation of standing; especially of the micro-movements in our ankles and whole body.
The process of how some automatic movements, little contractions and twitches, keeping us standing upright.
Something that is beyond our consciousness, but something we can definitely tap into by being more sensitive to it.
We can also use those unconscious micro-movements as a source of movement by amplifying it.

It is often used as a beginning of a grounding exercise, by shifting the weight, and keeping the center low.
Additionally, once the weight was totally shifted to one side, to ``double ground'' oneself to have an apparent sensation of stability and balance.

\section{Lifts}\label{sec:lifts}

The most common -- and most impressive -- ``spice'' added to a dance are lifts.
Whenever one center is located underneath another center, a lift can be easily performed by ``pouring one's weight''\footnote{Pouring weight is one of the core principles of CI, slowly and continuously increasing the pressure, instead of jumping on our partner with a potentially heavy impact and possible injury} onto the base.

There are different kinds of lifts, but the most typical ones are hip and shoulder-lifts.
When performing a \textbf{hip-lift}, the \gls{over-dancer} usually places his butt, lower belly or side on the lower back of the \gls{under-dancer}.
The \textbf{shoulder-lift} is the highest level of a lift where one ``flies'' on the shoulder of the other person.
Those lifts are usually done standing and also while being in the ``little animal'' position, and to change for example from a hip to a shoulder-lift, the over-dancer can spiral upwards the back defying gravity.

As a base, we need to ground ourselves to become more stable (and heavy) by focusing on our \gls{centergravity},
whereas the flyer, on the other hand, tries to make himself light and engage in his \gls{centerleviathan}.

Lifting might lead to potentially dangerous situations, which require us to pay special attention to the following safety rules:

\begin{itemize*}
    \item \textbf{Not grabbing} is a general rule, using less the hands and more the torso.
        With lifting this becomes even more important. Also \textbf{no interlocking} of the arms or grabbing the limbs of your flyer.
    \item Always keep a \textbf{hollow back} (a.k.a. ``\gls{goodgorilla}'') to provide a stable support for your partner instead of rounding your back, which makes him feel down and freak him out.
    \item Always keep your \textbf{head above ass}, otherwise your partner will most likely react with a fear response because of the danger of sliding down over your head (especially don't combine this with grabbing/interlocking).
\end{itemize*}

Read more about this in the~\nameref{ch:safety} chapter.

\section{Spirals}\label{sec:spirals}

We use a lot of spirally movement patterns in CI and pay special attention to how they are perceived, seen and anticipated in different movements in our own or someone else's body.
Moving in spirals is the perfect way to keep the pathway continuation which adds to a more enjoyable, fluid sensation during the dance.
Spiraling is considered a core movement pattern in CI and there is much more to say and experience about it.

Spirals can be very visibly be done between two body parts by moving from the distal parts of the body towards the more proximal parts.
There is a lot possible with playing with the axis, changing the axis, going within or outside the body, \ldots the limit is the imagination (and skill).
And ultimately spirals can also only by visualized, imagined, with pure intention/attention without any external visibility of movement.

\section{Negative Space}\label{sec:negative-space}

Dancing in the so-called \gls{negativespace} basically means entering, usually by reaching into it with a limb, the \gls{kinesphere} of another person without engaging in touch.
This is a common way to non-verbally invite someone for contact, to start a dance together, at a jam for example.

\section{Other Techniques}\label{sec:other-techniques}

\textbf{\Gls{body-surfing}} happens when one person rolls on the floor, and the other (usually) perpendicularly rolls over him.
Watch out if your partner is too heavy, to be able to release/distribute his weight, or simply drop your partner off in a gentle and polite way.
This usually evokes a lot of laughter due to the fun nature of it, its playfulness which reminds us of our childhood games we played.
For even more fun, consider doing a body-surf with more than two people and make some sort of ``body train''.

\textbf{Counter-balancing} is commonly used in partner-acrobatics, where the center is, for once, oppositional, instead of centers being shared.
We basically ``lean away'' from the partner, and by holding on to each other somehow, we balance each other out.
