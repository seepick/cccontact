NOT only in narrow sense (keep safe, injury-free, healthy) but also "social safety" (etiquette, norms, implicit behavior/expectations, culture)

* ad guardian angel: in sports/gym also called "spotter"; watches, takes care, safeguard
* "no risk no fun"
  * true, and: "too slightly much risk, never ever/no more fun at all anymore"
  * in a blink of an eye, it all can be over, never movement possible for the rest of your life
  * going too fast, too risky, too eager, too unfocused, not paying attention... better safe than sorry
  * we take it for granted too much, our health, our ability to move, to live without pain, our independence to manage daily life without external help
  * only when injured/sick we are aware of it; like IT infra/admins: only when it doesn't work we are aware of the amount of effort to keep it running, and how fragile it actually is; more gratitude for what is, less frustration when it isn't
* ad "good/bad gorilla": simply yoga's cat-cow ;)
* communicate your boundaries, and in extreme cases, talk to the organizers (teachers/hosts) for support
* always have multiple shirts, sweaty. maybe small tshirt. be washed, smell nice, but no intense scents/perfumes. (not really safety, but fits because of "dress code" for safety)
* dresscode: no jewelery (rings, ear rings, bracelets) as dangerous, no belt, not too much naked skin (sweaty, slippery, and for some people too sexy/uncomfortable; some decency, CI is a non-sensual practice)
* no "parking" or socializing on the dancefloor, move to the sides
* saying stop/no, consent, safety during dance. tom's workshop. orange/red boundary. not endura. last ressort: say out loud.
* dresscode: kneepads. which ones, what to watch out for. also for pants, not to loose because getting stuck.
* FESTIVAL/multi-day workshop: bring enough shirts, very very important (super sweater); 2-3 shirts per jam
  * usually day 4 is where the exhaustion hits (day 5 = injury, as energy empty; day 1 = overly excited, also risky)
* typical beginners mistake: grabbing with hands, and eyes closed
  * as usual: follow the rule, break the rule, become the rule (shu-ha-ri)
    * as an advanced, when you know what you are doing, you can do whatever you want
    * knowing the risks, deliberate decision to break the rule and take care of safety/compensate the risk)
    * manipulation isn't bad, grabbing can be a spice (later on)
  * hook/lock is not same as GRAB (chicken wing, munching pelvis (=chicken leg))
    * hooks are not a solution (usually), but a way of "cheating" (when e.g. off balance), a hack
    * it shouldn't be necessary, if done right (on-balance)
    * if base has sudden stops, the "water-body" (we are ~80% water) continues to move (inertia), will make you fall off
      * => use locks, or even better: extend limbs (as done in standing, use the "throwing momentum", that's more advanced/skilled than locks ;)
* INJURIES
  * they happen either because you have too much energy (overly excited and risk-friendly), or you have too little energy (tired, lazy, not paying attention)
  * if you do it long enough, you will see injuries; if you do it even longer, you will experience them yourself
  * those who had injuries (or at least seen them) are safe: knowing/experienced the riskiness of CI, thus being more careful
    * those who had no injury (or not even seen them) are unsafe: thinking it's all risk-free, thus being more careless
* how to be a good GUARDIAN ANGEL (=to spot someone):
  * be ready, active, arms forward, walk with the dancers, full attention, watch out for head; talk, give advice, tap
  * don't have hands in hips, arms/legs crossed, look/have attention somewhere else
* hair: self, if long, bind down (safety! when in floor work, being pulled); other: don't fuck it up, touch through
* ad clothing: wear socks when spiraling/rotating a lot of standing on the floor upright, otherwise skin rips off due to friction of rotating
* quick/sharp movement, dangerous! no octopus (round, all-inclusive, smooth, predictable)
  * breathe out, relax, let go, surrender
  * BUT: keep structure, don't collapse!
* practice recovery techniques, when falling, learn how to fall
  * e.g. upside-down, on back => super risky, solution: do a flip-flop!
    * don't rescue from mistake/accident, but instead improvise (because that's what we do), accelerate/enhance it even (the only way out is through)
    * use it as a source of input for a new, spontaneous inspiration for an unintentional movement.
  * being truly in the moment
* a GUARDIAN ANGEL's howto:
  * stay close to the head of the liftee; stay in his visible proximity (he can see you, he feels more safe)
  * stay present, watch out, stay focused; don't get distracted, don't like somewhere else
  * stay engaged: don't cross arms but have them close to the head and move around continuously; move, don't be frozen
  * give feedback: either verbally (corrections, suggestions, questions, invite/challenge), or simply breathe yourself to help others breathing

* ad jam, bring multiple shirts, because sweaty. in general: hygiene (body, mouth, clothes, nails), as close up.
* why not grab the hands? (it feels more safe)
