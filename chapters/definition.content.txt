* ad: what is it? not a dance, because with dance, both partners sync to the music, and thus are in sync with each other. strong connection to the music. CI is originally without music, and if there is music, it is veeery much in the background. we let the people be the navigator and the driver. a free form expression, without the restrictions/limitations/manipulation of the music's atmosphere... it's also not sports or acrobatics, it is more of a "relational mindfulness practice in movement".
* diff dance vs mindful partner movement: dance primary focus on music, secondary on partner. if both sync with music, they are in sync with each other. CI for example primary focus on the moment, the interaction, and music even not existing sometimes. also for free expression
* the improvised nature of CI:
    * there is no usually not enough time to do something intentionally, e.g. when spotting something (e.g. a possibility for some nice technique), because usually that moment disappears instantly
    * yes, we sometimes can plan it, push it, even force it, a deliberate thing to do; but usually it's just working with what is
* ad round-robin: usually 2,3,4 couples in center, in&out; or different format: half goes in (find partner, assign A/B), other half witnesses with full presence (learning passively)
* definition: "a research practice; the exploration of the physicalities between two bodies and the relation to the ground and gravity"
* what makes CI different: all levels (not just standing), it's 3D; and also 1/2/many people dancing with each other; it's goal is not to be aesthetical pleasing (as with most dance forms)
* ad jam, bring multiple shirts, because sweaty. in general: hygiene (body, mouth, clothes, nails), as close up.
* being in CONTACT or NOT? in old-school, lots of distance + impact play
  * today: tendency to stay permanently in contact; if distance happens, means immediately the end of the dance
  * is it possible to challenge this?! dance in negative space; to engage&disengage; dance in distance yet in "contact"
* the geometry of aerobatics (just bodies instead of airplanes; thus: "bodatics", or "somatics"?)
  * "aeroplane" and "acrobatics"
  * acrobatics: greek 'akrobatéō' = walk on tiptoe, strut
