* grammar (=principles) vs vocabulary (=techniques)
  * basic principles: grounding, sharing weight, pouring weight, rolling point of contact
* GRAMMAR: quality (of movement/state of being), principle; more subtle
  * VOCABULARY: techniques, tricks, pathways; more concrete


* Levels of Contact (Depth); Layers:
    => TODO: some exercise references here
  * Skin - Muscles - Bones
    * just an arbitrary but easy to work with distinction
    * not meant to be taken literally; e.g. elbow almost immediately bone touching... more about pressure/tension: light - medium - heavy/hard
  * first stand (then walk), change depth of contact with feet on the ground
    * engage in center of gravity/levithian for this
    * basically amount of tension in body, releasing (pressure) into the ground
  * sensation while standing/walking/with partner:
    * SKIN: like walking on thin ice; on egg shells, careful; no sound = soft feet
      * like a feather, just touch, no weight
    * MUSCLE: something in-between skin-bones;
      * sharing weight (regular quality)
    * BONES: full relaxation, heavy, rooted
      * active push (not a fight though)
  * usually sharing weight (and grounding), is between muscle+bones (where our style is mostly in; other CI styles may be softer, or even harder)
    * different dance-regions/cultures have different default-depths
    * ours more heavy; no right/wrong, but different, know those differences, pros/cons
      * more weight is also more connection; or is it?!
      * is it more advanced to feel same (center-) connection with less weight (skin contact)?
      * technically not really possible to feel center, yet necessary, maybe still some communication possible?
  * a jump (when being lifted) : can be either soft (yes) or hard (not preferrable)
    * hard: creates a gap/distance for a moment, leading to high impact, and risk for injury (surprise)
    * soft: stays connected with the partner all the time
    * jumps used to quickly travers through layers (skin to bone)
  * to connect with partner, we first need to sync our depth levels (both in same)
    * otherwise not meeting each other (one pushes the other away) middle
  * depth relate to tonality
    * SKIN: air, relaxed (but not caressing)
    * MUSCLE: water/honey, active tonality
    * BONE: concrete, slow, very big angles/round, tense
  * oldschool CI: going from no contact into bone immediately; basically a (risky) clash
* beginners want to just enjoy, not willing to invest the necessary work ("too technical" they say; destroyed all their joy and fun). these people won't get far anywhere, not in CI nor in life in general. yes, fun/pleasure is important, but that itself won't get us anywhere. it's like learning to drive a car: first it might be fun to play as children in the car of our parents while it's turned off, but we don't actually getting somewhere. later we take driving lessons, very technical, hyper focused, tensed... not fun. once we mastered the steering wheel, padels, mirrors and rules in traffic, we can start to play and enjoy again, doing risky tricks/moves, have a talk and listen to music. BUT: there is no shortcut, we need to go through the intermediate state of hard work to finally reach the other end where there is joy again, built upon a firm foundation of repetition, dedication and commitment.
* 1hr of class (=receiving new input) needs to be in proportion of about 3 hours of individual practice (repetition; focused/attentive/high-quality exercise). to research, "lab". doing the old, not adding something new again. or in the metaphor: once the building is built, and you want to add another floor/a tower, you have to improve the foundation first, otherwise: collapse (confusion, mixing up, messing up, mistakes, unclarity).
* as a newbie, always good to let your partner know. ps: you are not too much, to the contrary, give more weight.
* how to warm up yourself?
    * first of all: do it, don't wait for the teacher-parent to instruct you, to tell you what to do; you are supposed to be a grown up, so start take care of yourself (more important that you do it, instead of what you are doing)
    * easy way: just do what the teacher usually instructs at the beginning of the class -better: understand why he is doing it, and only do it if its applicable
    * lying down, as most dancers would do? maybe for some deep internal investigation, for increased body awareness (mindfulness practice), yes, maybe; for CI? not sure...
    * more inwards: mental awareness, stillness, parasympathicus (psychological body) VS active, physical awareness, sympathicus (physical body)
    * better: use CI to wake up CI relevant body parts! :) we mostly stand, so stand during your warm up; spiral; lifts, rolls, ... do everything you would usually do, just a bit slower/calmer/easier... turned down more. get yourself a partner and just dance, the best!
* basic body skills: relaxation (not stiff), listening (following), gentle/softness, flexibility/mobility, in joints, balance, general body awareness.
* BREATHE - BREATHE - BREATHE - BREATHE
  * all the time!!! in any position. don't hold your breath. and especially breathe OUT.
* beginner's mistakes:
    * instead of floating, making themselves light, people tend to be a heavy iron ball
    * there is an eagerness (adrenalin, excitement) which can be dangerous; or simply destroying the beauty of an "it's just happening" experience (jumping instead of pouring weight)
    * counter-acting your inner doubts, blocking your success: use positive affirmation, it is easy, you are light (some of us feel too heavy, a burden...)

* how i can expand in the "teaching" chapter. a good teacher ...
  * will allow you to explore/research by yourself; time wise, but also open that you do it slightly differently; there is no right/wrong but differences in goals/context/approaches
  * will invest enough time for the psychological/personal, the bonding of the group into a community to create a safe space (sharings, etc)
  * acknowledges his limits in practical ability and knowledge; he will admit and own it with confidence; being realistic, down to earth, humble
* eyes closed VS eyes open... why (not). when. TODO.
* a beginner's attitude, a researcher's mindset: nothing right/wrong, just different. know the difference, ask/question, experience yourself by trying all alternatives. then, by knowing the context/circumstance, you can choose the most appropriate solution.
  * as a total beginner, you might wanna blindly follow though, as you are missing the basic tools to research yourself and understand deeper mechanics.
