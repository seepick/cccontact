* habitual pathways
* we are usually taught dance by repetition; watching and imitating
  * a circular conversation, conservative situation; guide to cultural expectations
  * large mirror usually in studios, help for adjustment (peek, correct, look right)
    * sensation of movement add up to the movement they have been given
  * musculoskeletal sensations necessary for negotiations with gravity
* dancers must hack their basic movement programs in order to adapt to new movements
* human walking, each move begins with a touch-down upon the surface of the earth
* ad movement qualities: add speed, also pausing
* full body movement: arms + hands, head + eyes; with them engaged, everything gets much easier and moves better (try the opposite, go ahead)
* developmental movement: https://youtu.be/3115sM76KgM?si=9akgbmVInmLuwZrF ++ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3115sM76KgM
* have a moveable pelvis
    * other dance styles do it to look sexy; CI does it to "be" sexy ;) hehe
    * no, seriously: purely functional reason, to lift (especially hip lift), to connect
    * to sense, to connect, to lift
    * no, seriously seriously: CI can be seen as a highly sensual/sexual practice (although often people try to keep that out as much as possible); we humans are sexual beings, and by forcing it into the shadows, it might overpower us unconsciously, and there it may become dangerous; instead, acknowledge it, play with it, yet don't act upon it, stay in control; the plevis must be free, so our sexual energy must be allowed to flow freely; the pelvis, where our sexuality resides (2nd chakra according to tantra; like tantric exercises pelvis release)
    * if sexuality is blocked, CI doesn't work either (yet alone the obvious reason of no physical proximity, touch, intimacy possible; yet no sexuality/sensuality needed)
* ad movement: kinesphere; picture is similar to Da Vinci's "vitruvian man" but more complex
* developmental pattern terminology:
  * YIELD: into the ground; doing it physically to ground
  * PUSH: against the ground; doing it physically to ground
  * PULL: to the center inwards; doing it mentally to ground
  * REACH: outwards; doing it mentally to ground

* sample (movement/body) qualities: push, pull, ground, yield, reach, extend,... float, tense, tension, lethargic, ...
* definitions:
  * different types: technical / narrative / imaginary
  * the way we define those qualities is the way we dance; so listen carefully to each other's definitions (no need to agree, just acknowledge)
* talking about movement qualities; just "imaginary" words... in the end, just muscle contraction exists
  * imaginary language can help to convey meaning, as reality (literal talk) would be too complex
  * the way we use our body is in an abstract command language:
    * reach for a cup, instead of contracting flexor carpi radialis (we don't know which muscle that is, let alone the medical term of it)
    * translation unit in the brain, like asterix (plan) and obelix (execution)
    * we are operating on a higher level of abstraction
* when doing solo exercises (qualities), allow yourself to enjoy it; pleasure of movement (like in gaga)
* small dance is: active yield and push; but also reach + pull
  * grounding has all 4 qualities; embody them, experience them
* shared center of mass: when 2 bodies share weight (lean on each other, push, or some contact), they become kind-of 1 body and have 1 center (of gravity/mass)
  * like visualizing a red dot (or a ball, when more surface contact, becomes bigger and more fuzzy)
  * giving weight, when it moves too sharply => danger!
* similar to taijiquan:
  * push while bending (going up while going down; like higher sophisticated weight-lifting)
    * let gravity pull, while "push against" (without actually pushing, or at least muscle activation below a threshold where movement actually happens
    * like when a limb is on the ground, trying to lift it with too little effort to be able to lift it, that amount!)
    * use only intention
  * how about using an "inflating" quality as in taijiquan? (pang jin)


PUSHING
------------------------
* anatomical/physical => muscles: extension, sarcomere bigger distance; ATP consumed, effortful (rigor mortis)
* 2 (or more) bodies involved (e.g.: me + wall)
* the ground can't be pushed, it only maintains its structure
  * same as a trampoline (kinetic force in, and bounce back), or spring quality in martial arts
* pushing without grounding possible, but structure will pay the price
* be more nuanced with push: soft push (comfortable), sharp/hard push (annoying)
* a rubber band charged with an object (bullet), is it pushing?!
* when 2 dancers use push, often it results into a small fight (instead of "small dance")
  * playing against instead with each other (especially 2 men)
* push is underused as easily considered "rude"; taking away most precious agency
  * CI is egalitarian, different from other dance styles with leader/follower roles, where manipulation is rather the norm, nothing else.

PUSHING DEFINITIONS
------------------------
* "more is more":
  * using a deliberate/intentional, expanding (external/outward, away from center, forward-directed) force to manipulate an object's position
  * e.g. resulting in destabilization (attack/dislike) or support (defend/protect).
  * because it's an active wanting, it's exhaustive and requires a counter-push to maintain equilibrium.
* physical/technical:
  * exerting controlled, deliberate force to an object to move it away from one's center.
* physical/imaginary:
  * like there is a balloon inflating inside your body, and it has only one possible gate to expand, which is the body part you want to push.
* physical/narrative:
  * like when two deer fight with each other, bumping their heads, pushing into the ground, to fight about their position in the hierarchy.
* psychological:
  * increase personal/emotional distance, to challenge someone (friendly invitation, support; emphasize urgency if being ignored) or create own safety.
  * a "pushy person" is an annoying person who wants too much.
* universal:
  * increasing the distance between two objects by making an effort.
  * the opposite of pull.

PULLING
------------------------
* bring mutual mass closer, exert force on each other
* opposite of push, active, otherwise same (2 bodies) but inwards (2 bodies towards each other), contraction
* gravity is ALWAYS pulling (exerting force)
* if you pull someone, you have to either push the floor OR counter-pull
* it requires some connection to be pulled on
  * but we don't grab in CI (usually); alternative attachment: lock, hook
* edge case, when pulling sideways:
  * the distance of the bodies doesn't change, so the point of reference moves from puller to pullee
  * towards center = push sideways, away from his center = pull sideways

PULLING DEFINITIONS
------------------------
* physical/technical:
  * exerting controlled, deliberate force to an object to move it closer towards one's center.
* physical/imaginary:
  * like you are so terribly hungry, a little black-hole has formed in your lower belly, sucking everything in like the strongest dyson vacuum device you've ever seen.
* physical/narrative:
  * the same as the moon can't escape the earth, and the earth can't escape the sun, so we can't escape the floor, and our partner us if we pull them.
  * we become the sun, keeping the trabant (moon) firmly in our grip, like a spider keeps its prey in its web, no chance for it to escape.
* psychological:
  * feeling an irresistible attraction towards someone, like a gravitational force or a magnet.
  * feelings of strong, unexplainable sympathy. unconscious desire to be close to that person.
* universal:
  * decreasing the distance between two objects by making an effort.
  * the opposite of push.

YIELDING DEFINITIONS
------------------------
* FINAL:
  * a neutral and voluntary resignation; a sign of healthy surrender, complying with what is, accepting it, yet not collapsing, maintaining structural integrity. by relaxation, allowing flexibility to adapt to incoming forces of push&pull. a soft confrontation into. to produce by obedience.
* IN SENTENCES:
  * to yield is a neutral and voluntary way of resignation, a sign of (healthy) surrender/submission, complying/accomodating of what is, acknowledge/accepting the current state; yet not collapsing, maintaining structure where necessary.
  * it is done by softening/relaxing, allowing for flexibility in order to adapt/complement to incoming forces; whether push/pull (gravity/partner/argument).
  * A "soft confrontation into".
  * Or simply: to produce a result by obeying.
* SHORTS:
  * to accept/embrace a state/force by relaxing into it
  * a neutral form of voluntary resignation to what is
  * allowing things to happen as they are
* KEYWORDS/BRAINSTORMING:
  * give up/in, go with, surrender, comply, accommodating, submit, neutral/voluntary resignation
  * follow/accompany, acknowledge/allowing/accept/embrace (state/force), give way to pressure (argument/influence)
  * soft(en), relax (where necessary! more stable than collapse)
  * complement/wrap around, adapt, flexible, bendable
  * "soft confrontation into"
  * downwards (with gravity)
  * OR: produce a result, giving (a)way
* physical/technical:
  * to voluntarily give in to an incoming force (usually gravity, but also the partner) in a controlled matter.
* physical/imaginary:
  * like when you throw a big blanket over your bed, it gently floats down, and wraps around the pillow underneath it.
* physical/narrative:
  * as if your body is a candle, and a spotlight is heating certain parts of your body, making it moldable, melting down to the ground.
* psychological:
  * to submit and accept defeat, in resignation of a superior force, knowing there is no other way, still with one's head up.
* universal:
  * by softening voluntarily adapting to what is.

REACHING
------------------------
* vs push?
* active muscle engagement, elongating, outwards, inviting
* initiated from extremities (fingers), penetrating (pointy, sharp)
* reaching is aiming for an object in range, without moving the center; if further away, need to move
* beginners usually move within kinesphere, especially when in contact; more advanced: extend, intention + attention into space
* to stretch out/put forth (a body part); to touch/grasp by stretching out; to arrive at, attain
* how's reaching possible if underlying there's only contraction happening?
  * physical level: it's like "no hot/cold because only temperature", or steering will "push one, thus pull other", it's transactional like buy/sell
  * pulling on joint from one side, push on the other; if bone would be straight then yes, impossible; but because joint + muscles on sides attached...

REACHING DEFINITIONS
------------------------
* physical/technical:
  * stretching out to touch/grasp something.
* physical/imaginary:
  * like a flower growing towards the sun, always have this one goal, always directed towards it.
* physical/narrative:
  * like a sad baby when it finally sees its mother, desiring proximity, the milk bottle, the breast.
* psychological:
  * to initiate/establish contact with another person.
* universal:
  * outwards shift to contact something further away.

EXTENDING
------------------------
* vs expansion?
* similar to reach but more
* can also be soft, no muscle tension needed
* extending without a counter is like pushing without grounding
* add-on/plugin
* soft, wavey, from the core outwards
* reach towards something, extend goes beyond
* reach has intention to aim for an object, extension can be by itself
* reaching includes extending, but extending not reaching (?)
* extend is beyond the kinesthetic ability (send intention)
* elongate + intention going beyond the physical body = extend (a bit "la la land", not really physically doing it, but a mental thing)
* almost invisible in action
* how's extending possible?
  * it's lala land; only mind intention
  * physically: reach to limits, then relax some (big) muscle fibers (keep medium/small ones), with bone-stacking
  * extending is not expanding
  * extending is possible from everywhere, but easiest from the extremities; straight line (contra-lateral) easiest
  * e.g. in ballet they extend in a curved line
* extend not only from fingers (or toes) but with all parts of the body

EXTEND DEFINITIONS
------------------------
* physical/technical:
  * once reaching the maximum extension by stretching out, add just a tiny bit even more by a soft relaxation.
  * using imagination/intention to go further than reaching (within body) but move into space (outside body).
* physical/imaginary:
  * when a spacecraft leaves the orbit, the solar system, the galaxy. further than we can see. yet it's out there.
* physical/narrative:
  * like a string far away is pulling you somewhere on your body while you are chained on the ground, and it keeps pulling and pulling.
  * like your soul is leaving your body, moving further than you can possibly can.
* psychological:
  * being more than the original limits, going beyond them, growing, giving it more.
* universal:
* going beyond certain limits.

LEANING
------------------------
* often confused with sharing weight (or pushing)
* being off-center, off-balance
* giving all your own burden to the partner
* often with an overly stiff body, like a plank
* can be used as a source of inspiration for a movement; something for the more advanced

BONE-STACKING
------------------------
* a pure biomechanical alignment of hard tissue (bones) to relieve softer and more effortful structures (muscles, tendons)
* to be able to hold force/weight effortlessly, by letting aligned posture do the work instead
* a game/play with geometry and gravity; every adapting to a changing environment
* allowing for a more relaxed position (bones > muscles)
* it requires a big amount of proprioception and sensitivity to external forces

IN COMPARISON
------------------------
* grounding: single (action, doesn't require someone/something else); push/yield: interaction (requires someone)
* grounding != lean/push; to ground = within my center; to lean = no skill, just unbalanced; to push = active, closed, tensed (and tension masks sensation)
* yield VS collapse
  * Y: localized, controlled, stay stable, always voluntary, maintain structure
  * C: extreme, global, dead, 0%, risky
* push is the opposite of yield; a continuum
* push + pull is adding tension; yielding is removing tension; collapsing is yielding without control
* pushing requires a counter-force, usually grounding
* yielding is the cousin of grounding, but more extreme
* yielding is contained on grounding (to gravity)
* pushing is the opposite of yielding
* yielding is purely passive, pushing is purely active (grounding is in-between)
* a soft push contains yielding
* grounding is controlled, yielding is collapsed; yielding is passive, pushing is active
* grounding is the prerequisite for sharing weight
* lean VS pull: leaning is off-balance, whereas pull is still grounded
* difference: ground (down relax) / push (closed, contract) / lean (off-balance)
* yield and push are opposites
* most people confuse tension (closing muscles) with grounding/extending
* how does grounding relate to floating/leviathan? in taijiquan...
  * the upper body/arms are floating lightly (yang, towards the heaven)
  * the lower part, legs, pelvis is grounded (yin, towards earth)
  * the center (men) connects both worlds, united in one (dao)

----------

* ability for DISCRIMINATION of body parts:
  * necessary for many things
  * rolling point of contact, spiraling, moving from a specific part, ...
  * general body awareness skill
* when talking about spirals, add a lot of drawings. e.g. spherical spiral, cyclindric siral; vortex; spiral/helix from top and side
* incorporate Movement Notation document (kinesiology, etc.)
* incorporate developmental pattern
