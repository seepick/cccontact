\chapter{Principles}\label{ch:principles}

\chapterCoverImage{principles}

This chapter is maybe the most important one in the whole book.
It captures the \textbf{essence} of CI, as without the principles it is not it anymore.
We will have a look at the few core principles, and the requirements to be able to apply them.
We will also further include some side principles and \textbf{movement patterns} usually mentioned in the same sentence.
