* when walking out of the studio, we usually forget to be conscious of our movements

* substances/molecules called drugs VS plant medicine; healthy alternative; sex, cuddle, dance!
  - drugs (illegal ones; weed, XTC/MDMA, cocaine), supposedly "plant medicine" (toxins/poisonous substances; ayahuasca, magic mushrooms/truffles) or legal drugs (psychoactive substances; alcohol, coffee, tabacco)
    - alcohol: rotten stuff; mushrooms: defense substance not to be eaten; LSD/cocaine: a funghi
    - many romantic associations with "natural drugs" (vs artificial ones); only what can be plugged and eaten (to eliminate cocaine)
    - is it a drug or a medicine? does makes the poison? a political thing. it's a molecule, and on that level there is no discrimination (good/bad, drug/medicine, natural/artifical); in the end, everything gets somehow "processed" (in the guts), so what's the difference natural/artificial anyhow?
    - even breathwork, esp. holotropic breathing, pushing the body out of its homoestasis, fighting against it; basically a blood poisoning by dysbalancing the oxygen-carbondioxide proportion
    - how about physical activity?
      - sex: super healthy, no side-effects, but can also be very addictive and it requires (at least) a partner to be available
      - cuddles: also super healthy, but unfortunately in our society it is limited to a single romantic partner, and we don't allow ourselves to cuddle with anyone else outside of such an engagement
      - sports: can have some positive effects, but usually conventional sport is not emphasizing any psychological aspects where one would feel similar positive effects ("high") after a good sex-cuddle session or any substance-intake
      - dance: besides that it may require some skill (and money to pay for lessons), there are only pros: it is healthy, has no side-effects, and has a high availability; there are many schools/classes for partner dance, and it is socially accepted to dance even intimately with strangers (even when in a monogamous relationship), and we do it usually with lots of different people (changing partners).
        - among dance styles, contact improvisation is one of the most ("the most"?) intimate form there is, and thus nourishes us also the most, substituting for any need for ingesting any molecule, or bringing our body in any potentially harmful dysbalance through intervening with its internal state.
    - of course a more philosophical question, to be 100% sober (all natural), or whether we can utilize items, and go beyond nature
