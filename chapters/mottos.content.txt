* !!! next to quoting them => also provide an elaborative exlanation of it (like daodejing)
  * "die before die, in order to live"; martial arts quote; not fear, otherwise stuck and fail
* feldenkrais; impossible - possible - easy - elegant
* martial arts: die before you die, in order to live; look the death in its eyes; to suppress is to maintain; the only way out is through; be fearless, and you will survive
* dance with the partner, not with the skill
    * address the situation of dancing with partners of different levels (with perspective of you being in different levels)
    * all the possible combinations, and how to still get the most out of it
* MOTTO: "i trust you fully, and i trust myself more"
  * never just fall/lean on a partner without being able to catch yourself; always be able to catch yourself, never rely on others only
  * yet, dare to let yourself fall fully; trust, surrender, give weight; it's a sequence: fully trust, and afterward self-catch
* we don't divide attention, but multiply it; 100% inside, 100% partner, 100% space
  * it's like alternating current (electricity) or pseudo parallelism for CPUs through interrupts of scheduler)
* "if you don't fail/fall once in a while, you are doing it wrong" - a research/growth attitude.
