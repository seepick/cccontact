===========================================================================
* when dancing in negative space with partner, don't only sense the center, but (for more advanced people) sense also their breath
* when moving from head (actually even better from the eyes), the spine becomes more agile.
  * when being lifted landing on the back (not belly), then for sure lead from the head; super advanced, super scary, and super fun (those spirals, everything upside down)
* ... MAXIMUM RELAXATION/SOFTNESS ...
* add https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziran
* clarity; solo: clear intention with yourself, where you wanna go (staccato 5rhthyms), otherwise all wobbly and unstable; couple: as a leader, giving clear signals, otherwise follower will fuck-up, not knowing your intentions; group: as a leader/facilitator, if there is no clarity in your mind, the group (just as the follower, or your body in a solo) will get insecure, not knowing what to do, restlessness, at unease, down to mistrust and anxiety; like in project management: any decision is better then none; sometimes just do it, and even if it's wrong, you can fix it afterwards

* "in my head"
  * what it means: to have distracting thoughts, unproductive, irrelevant here
  * yet, don't confuse with focused attention; being present, with "heart and brain", with "body and head"; united
  * if growth is relevant, then it is effortful
  * stages
    * as a beginner: just fun, effortless, chaotic
    * intermediate: hard effortfull work, precise, controlled
    * advanced: effortless, precise and controleld, or chaotic if choses to (knowing the risks)
    * like driving a car: as a child, pretend to drive, super fun, without effort, talking while doing; then doing hard work of exam for a driver license, having to practice and study theoretically, stress in traffic; and now as an adult again enjoying driving without even thinking about it, effortless, on auto pilot, as in "how did i get home?"
* when advanced look for beginners to dance with; something that happens often in the (professional) dance community:
  * they want to get inspired, breaking their habits/patterns; beginners are not yet too "biased" (betriebsblind); otherwise usually "incest" (like in martial arts)
  * to get back to the more (relevant) basic principles; they are bored by the hoopedipoop-techniques (lifts)
* language metaphor:
  * beginners don't talk the language yet, still they try to say "something", so they just say random things; sometimes they are lucky, and say something of meaning, yet not knowing what the meaning of it is; an accident; something that will lead to a surprise
  * when I speak french, but you speak spanish, after some time of not being successful understanding each other, we simply switch back to the common denominator: gibberish. only (simple) tone/melody, making sounds (movement), but no (exclusive) words/grammar (lifts)
* "you see, you know immediately, whether someone got skill or not; you see their personality expressed; the flow, the talents... try to make it explicit. what is it precisely that makes them so? enumerate criteria"
* unconscious processing of information
  * e.g.:
    * "sensing the center of your partner"
    * "sensing energy": more generally what people, esp. women/hippies say
    * "sensing energy in the room":
      * when meant literally, as in some meta-physical substance being able to be perceived in some not yet known sensory organ
      * instead of the more likely event of being unaware of the unconscious processing of regular sensory information
      * visual obviously, but also olfactory lots going on below conscious level
        * e.g. cave, bear, fear story
    * people just don't know any better, they explain it with romantic stories
      * because otherwise nothing available to explain it
* don't seek perfection, but learn how to deal with unexpected outcomes (=mistakes) and use them to make it perfect (by improvising, and working with what is; "recovery strategies")
* tip for practitioners: set reminder every X months to redefine all terms (what is CI for me; qualities; principles; values; ... they regularly change)
* achieve symmetry: e.g. with spirals, standing, with foot starting, one side is easier, try to be good with both
    * although arguments for strengthening our strengths, and accept and use the asymmetry
* "the longer i do it, the slower i go, the fewer trickery i need, as i find {pleasure and joy? fulfillment and satisfaction! meaning and purpose} in the subtleties revealed in depth ('death'?)"
    * the more advanced/experienced i get, the slower i become, more depth in simplicity; no shiny tricks (that's for the intermediate ones); less lifts, more listening
    * when there is trust, we can go high; feeling safe, by going slow, being fully present
    * once we trust, we can go higher and faster
    * PS: acrobats often/usually/always (?) go (very) fast, and lots of tricks very quick, that's potentially very dangerous and they need to learn to slow the fuck down, to surrender in the slowness, to also explore the depth, to go deeper and find sensations in the subtleties, and be less easily attracted/entertained by the superficial trickery
* three stages: beginner's (simple) joy, intermediate's hard work, expert's (sophisticated) joy
    * the reward comes later after the (hard) work
    * fun/pleasure is part of it, it is important to maintain dedication, to not lose motivation, as work alone is not really sustainable (yes, it requires discipline!)
    * but it alone will not get you very far; "up there" is much more fun than "down there"
* list of hints on how to identify a beginner/advanced:
    * clothing: beginners show often lots of skin, dressed sexy; advanced wear their (non-sexy) pyjamas, long sleeves/pants; it's not tango, we don't want to impress, we are who we are, authentical us, not more not less. also sliding on the ground is not possible with direct skin contact, thus skin is covered.
    * touch: beginners use a lot the fingers and hands with a very very soft "butterfly touch" (usually hippie people from the ecstatic dance community); advanced use more the torso and have a weighted touch, when using (fore)arms even those are properly weighted
        * yet, it is not binary/extreme: advanced also can have "cat feet" and have versatile hands. butterfly touch is ok, but not if it is the only tool in your toolbox, and it should be definitely not the default.
    * steps: beginners make lots of little elephants, quick, sharp, loud steps, indicating uncontrolled and potentially dangerous moves; advanced can step like feathers (butterfly steps and elephant arms; not other way round)
* how to assess someone's level of skill? give weight or not, pathway continuation or breaking (front of body), jumping, elephants, etc. breath, stiffness/relaxation/muscle tone.
* uncommon spices: manipulation of the head, counter-balancing
* beginners and advanced are safe, just the intermediates are dangerous
  * BEGINNERS: they know that they don't know (and can't) yet, they go slow, are humble
  * ADVANCED: they know their limitations (like beginners, are humble too), and when to break the rule safely
  * INTERMEDIATE: overly confident, risky behavior, showing off; insecure-arrogance; dunning-kruger effect
    * anti-dot: humbleness, open-mindedness; going slow! ask for feedback; be more precise; back to basics
* beginner's mistake: don't INVITE yourself on your partner
  * ability to say&hear a yes/no to/for an INVITATION for lifting
    * never force yourself on your partner (== invite yourself), but be slow, be perceptive, listen carefully, be with your partner
  * in the netherlands we make an appointment to meet, and not just knock at the door like a surprise-visit
    * thus, don't jump on your partner, heavy impact, unexpected, and potentially dangerous (and impolite)
  * the base decides a lift (usually); with already familiar partners, you may surprise them
* STRENGTH VS technique: one can compensate for the other
  * strength has limitations and gets weaker the older we get, technique (sensitivity, alignment/posture, etc.) has none (infinite possibility to grow, to get more sensitive)
  * "what I lack of technique, I compensate with strength. the one who hasn't strength, must only rely on technique."
    * ultimately it's better to have both available if possible ;)
    * technique vs strength. see martial arts wisdom... the less technique i have, the more i need to compensate with strength; preferrably i have both; technique never ends, always can increase (more sensitive), even when getting older; strength has a limit, and decreases with age; technique makes things more effortless (but mind needs to engage more, than body), relaxed, thus smooth/elegant
* the SMALL THINGS matter: eyes, fingers, hands
  * if the EYES go down, we are in a state of hyperfocus (not good); we need to be more relaxed, look into the space
    * have a blurry, relaxed, peripheral vision with your surrounding (also safety wise important); catch all, non-focused
    * stay connected to the "big body", don't go into a hyper-internal-focus-state (ecstatic dance)
  * contact people vs contact dancers: 1) are amateurs, reach only until the wrist 2) are professionals, reach beyond the FINGERS
  * new animal "DEAD FISH HANDS": we are not active, not engaged. same with pilates/yoga/ballet/dancers: if the fingers reach, the whole body will be more engaged (same with good taijiquan practitioners, which only very few are able to do)
* problem of "always doing the SAME", STUCK in the same movement patterns / how to learn new pathways?
  * very common, especially among professional dancers (they dance with beginners to get inspired, as those are still freed from the limitations of a specific system)
  * solutions:
    * ask a partner to PAUSE you, touch a body, and move from there.
      * or let him control your body (e.g. remote control your head); surrender, and let yourself be guided.
    * SURRENDER, let your partner inspire/manipulate you
    * go very FAST (but watch: risky), as "in chaos lies creation" (creativity); like 5 rhythms, shiva.
    * when you are stuck with a familiar PARTNER ("shared patterns"), go find a new partner
* always ADAPT the technique (timing/weight-giving/positioning/...) according to your partner's weight/size/strength/age/...
  * everything changes; stay open, listen, have different partners
* ADVANCED topics/aspects to emphasize: tonality, breaking the bubble
  * TONALITY (ad anatomy): muscle tone/tonus, amount of tension in muscles; should be in the middle, flexible like a bamboo/rubber plastic; relaxed yet not collapsed; active yet not stiff
    * EXERCISE (from gaga): imagine as if you would move through air/water/honey/concrete
  * "breaking the BUBBLE": reconnect to what is going on
    * the bubble being: eyes down, going inwards, not being present with the environment (big body/space)
* ways of LOOKING GOOD/impress/show-off (demonstrate):
  * collaboration/team work: if one fucks up, the other compensates (no passive/static posture)
  * cheating: use a lot of chicken wings/legs when off-balance
  * strength/use brute force: for compensating lack of technique
* TIP CORE STRENGTH: on how to work on your core strength for the superman position (reach, extend, being a rod/stick):
  * use a big inflatable ball (gymnastics), and balance on it in straightened position (belly, back, sideways)
* personal preference as images: i prefer dancing with scalpel, precise, elegant, fine, safe... not with hammers: rough, rigid, inaccurate, dangerous, ...
  * i like to dance with a jaguar, soft, gentile, agile, strong, quick if necessary, confident/humble/calm, playful, deadly
  * i don't like mosquitoes, just hyperactive, unstable, no core/essence, boring and annoying with their little "meeeee" sound
    * barking like a little dog but nothing behind it just showing-off, pretending out of insecurity
  * i also don't like dancing with hippos, fat, slow, heavy, immovable, stomping, insensitive tanks.
  * what does the personal like/dislike say about myself? my values/associations...
* difference beginner and master: master always knows the "why" (deeper understanding of the reason)
  * thus also can divert from the norm/rules (break them deliberately, and still it's not a mistake/error/fault; risk-free, responsible)
  * deliberate choice (circus bicycle clown like a beginner, because he decides to)
* if "the body always knows the truth" (and keeps the score ;) and "always trust (your) nature", how comes we have to work so hard to override our natural bodily impulses?
  * e.g. tensing up, holding breath, looking down, ...
  * is it just a maladaptive behavior? when fear and fall, tension is like a muscle shield.
  * or psychological-trauma-fuckup?! as children through shit, now acquired ineffective impulses/behaviors
  * thus, as babies we were in our "true" nature, and everything was indeed always reliable (seems like a romantic fairy tale to me)
* justifying doing "whatever" by saying it's "improvised", then what are we doing?
  * like shiatsu: if it's everything, it's nothing. to define, we need inner/outer, boundaries, to say what it's not, so we know what it is.
* be in HEAD and BODY: thinking focused on being present with physical sensations
  * being in the head; not only embody, but be conscious about it; to have deliberate choices to play with it
    * nothing is absolute (good/bad, just useful (or not) in specific circumstances; like a hammer/screwdriver)
  * "you can only not do it, if you can (deliberately) do it" (violence/fighting in martial arts)
  * CAVE/watch out: we have a tendency to justify our inability and laziness by saying:
    * "i use my intuition, i don't need to learn this or that"
    * "i'm in the flow, i don't need to make an effort"
    * "i am here to have fun and play, not to work or doing exercises as it brings me into my head and i don't enjoy it anymore"
    * first work needs to be done to gain the harvest (anyone who's promising you anything else is most likely after your money and/or your body); there are no shortcuts!
  * people want to be in the flow only, without doing the necessary hard work, but:
    * to even increase the flow capacity, we have to do the work; the play/fun gets even better with the work being done
    * when in flow, things already need to be available in autopilot, which requires hard/conscious work before, no way around it!
  * balance: 80/20, where there is frustration on bad days, there is the potential for growth
    * we need effortful work, play will not bring us through those times (wrong tool)
    * if you don't push through it but avoid, you will stay in the lower levels and not being able to see the beauty, the pleasure/fun/joy up high in the skies over the mountains
  * balance of yin/yang, think/feel, fun/work, flow/deliberate, ... have both available, to choose, no extremes, max 80/20, all relative, no absolutes; we need both (just tools)
  * "you are so much in your body for so long, overly emphasized by you and your environment, that you forgot how to use your head, something that makes you human, homo sapiens"
* "to be in the head" -depending on the precise definition- is required, a good thing, as in: paying attention to what's happening
    * 1) be of support when and where my partner needs it
    * 2) be aware of architecture/center/grounding of my partner
    * it's a continuous interplay of two:
        * A) conscious/deliberate/intellectual/analytical effort, and
        * B) unconscious/felt/sensed/intuitive/visceral process of information to respond to through movement
* in general, often under-represented: leading from the finger; also engage eyes, actively, leading from them (will move the head implicitly, no other way)
* playing with architecture, like drawing, research, curoisity; esp. with 3+ dances, more possibilities arise to construct interesting shapes
  * take time to find possibilities in a specific posture/structure/architecture, to know where weight can be given (and where it can't); a crucial skill to have an eye for that
* skill shows by moving without sound; like a big cat/tiger, elegant, fast, strong, powerful, soft, gentile; a silent killer
* advanced practitioners like to join beginner classes (enjoying the basics again), intermediate don't
* mastery is elegance. moving with as little movements as possible (just 1 curved lines). counting the number of differentiable movements (pathways). moving also with as little effort as possible (minimum is not equals zero); energy-efficiency. having to readjust because of initial misplacement is bad.
* Be aware of the difference between learning/practicing and dancing/applying it. (like in karate: the form/kata when practicing exact, when applying must be different, as adapted to the unique situation; and every execution/situation is different/unique)
  * While we practice, we do it more statically and use (as done in this technique) our hands to push into the partner/floor.
  * During a real dance, we would not use our hands, and instead push from our center/pelvis.
* using hands means cheating; sometimes though needed.
  * use hands to push, give leverage support; chicken wings/legs. in any of the 3 levels (floor, lil animal, standing(hip/shoulder))
* "good grab" vs "bad grab"
  * narrow sense: grab with hands, wrap around
    * wider sense: wrap around with any body part, also arms/armpit (even legs); thus chicken-wing/leg is a "soft grab"
    * intention difference: active grab is to manipulate/dominante (but also safeguard/seatbealt), passive grab is to not fall off (safety)
  * with the good: first base offers an invitation/question, then, and only then, when the flyer accepts it, the base can wrap a "safety belt"
  * bad grab: the base takes the flyer, without asking, without any reply, without consent, forcing his intention on the flyer; diminishing his autonomy/agency
  * (good jump/bad jump: finding each other with softness mid-air VS heavy impact)
- as advanced dance with beginners (or people with a different CI style/dialect): in order to learn/to grow/break patterns, let yourself be led, don't A) go back in your own comfort zone doing the same you already know and B) don't "enforce it" on the other; but instead follow, listen, be more passive and surrender
- in martial arts "incest" is happening (german: "betriebsblindheit")
  - always working with the same, within the same system; no diversity; it works because both play the game according to the very same rules, with the same principles; no surprise, no challenge, thus no real skill/growth
  - big issue in martial arts, as it is competitive, and once fighting with someone from a different system, it won't work anymore
    - less of an issue in (partner) dance, as it is collaborative (working together, instead against)
    - BUT: narrow experience/skill through narrow exposure, thus not able to deal with "wide range" of what happens, with surprise
- masculinity is too much, because it is afraid of being "not (good) enough"; femininity is too little, as it is afraid of "being too much"
  - whether it's taking up space as in talking time, attention, getting needs satisfied, leading (in movement or life; being assertive/dominant), or simply giving weight (men are too heavy and stiff, women are too light and collapsed/lethargic)
* ultimate goal is "elegance". minimum effort. minimum adjustments necessary afterwards, cheat, incorrect/imprecise placements.
* not-wanting theory:
  * buddhism: is saying "don't attach" (to an idea/thing), i'd say they are wrong, like christianity denying the worldly, the pleasures, the deep joy (with it's potentially deep suffering)
  * zen: is saying "be able to detach again"; story with the monk walking, given a porsche for free (buddhists/christian would say no), he drives, car has full accident (capitalist would feel bad, unable to detach), he walks again without any worry
  * in CI: it's ok to have a plan (what to do next) BUT be able to let go of it if the moment requires (if it's not possible); the window of opportunity is usually rather short, so have to act in the moment, as with every tick of thinking about it how/what to do, time runs out and the window closes again
    * don't force it, as it creates a disconnect, a bump
  * daoism: observe and adapt to the flow of nature (nature in sense of spinoza, not the romantic green stuff, nothing esoteric, but universe, natural laws, like physics, the inherent order of things given by itself)
* good jump: no impact (landing) on the partner, but used for momentum (turning, twisting) while the pressure on the partner stays constant; a connected movement, together, instead of a disconnected one (no listening possible, no moving along together thus no impact)
* motto, mastery. "Creative thought without guided practice—structured repetition—leads to great ideas with poor execution." -- stan goldberg
  * repetition is the path to mastery
  * boring, but necessary to achieve
  * first slow, perfection. then only increase speed
  * if you dont use it, you lose it
  * making it automatic, like walking. we also had to learn that once.
  * in our today's western society considered as boring. no commitment, everything needs to be fun/pleasurable (hedonistic?), no hard work, no dedication; only superficial, no depth.
  * making it into an automatism.
  * musicians, 8 hours a day, scales, for decades
  * sword fighters, 5000 cuts a day, every day, for decades
  * any world champion, in sports or whatever: repetition is the key
  * especially repetition of the basics. over and over again. yet, with quality (not only focus on quantity). don't practice imperfection. not speed either, but with focused attention.
* mushin quality, not doing, not forcing
  * realizing potential
  * sword fighting story: me cutting, not working. teacher cutting, two times, once mid-air. you want, you will not go straight. you let it happen, with a quick impulse at the beginning, and let the sword do its thing, through momentum and gravity, it will all go well, trust.
    * add picture of karlheinz cutting, when telling the story
  * when the window of possibility opens, to take it. when it's too late, and it closes again, don't rush it or break it open.
  * a thin line betwen forcing and realizing potential.
* "skill is measured by principle (basics/foundation) adherence , not shiny/cool lifts (with lacking any principle adherence)"
* body awareness: a mental activity; the spotlight shining; it's about the source of the light, not its target surface
  * what people mean: unnecessary chatter of the mind; irrelevant topics being chewed on; being distract, lack of ability to focus
* mastery through balance within oneself (full-range)
    * when the warriors turn into fairies; when the warrior becomes soft
    * other way round as well: when the fairies find their stability, grounded
* overly masculine society and thus values.
  * the way they do exercises. observe yourself
  * more effort the better. self exploitation. going over ones own boundaries...
  * visible, or better: hearable, men breathing not relaxed, but squeezed and loud.
  * effortful, too much
  * elegance is effortless.
    * technique/skill instead brute force; force compensating lack of skill
    * also: going too fast, like driving a car.
    * it is an internal sensation, quality over quantity.
    * ego wants to measure (penis length)
    * chinese dao knows that softness overcomes hardness
      * stiffness breaks, like a dry tree branch.
* quote: "Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast" - special forces (US navy SEALs) / mitsuyo maeda (japanese budo master)
  * Lao Tzu, “Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.”

  * applied when learning something new
  * if you can't do a technique right slow, then doing it faster will be even worse
    * either dangerous or just wasted energy
  * learn to do something slow and smooth first and then add speed
  * speed hides hiccups, flaw in your technique
  * Going slow helps you train for precision. Precision makes speed more effective. There is no point in being fast if you are fast and sloppy.
  * Moving fast (on purpose) usually creates tension. Practice slow/un-tensed to create a relaxed and efficient motion, and over time, that smooth efficiency becomes "fast".
  * Speed will come with time
  * emphasize fluidity and precision. A well-executed technique is swifter than a hurried one.
* exercise attitude (like in karate doing a kata):
    * during an exercise, do it:
        * very slow, precise
        * staccato, checkpoints, squared, edgy
        * predictable, planned upfront, deliberate
    * change everything when applied
        * be dynamic, constantly moving
        * fluid, round
        * spontaneous
* always be able to give the reason, the WHY; and also know+show the way how to do it CORRECTLY
* danger comes from a discrepancy between risk and skill
    * risk: speed, technical show-offs (lifts), distance
    * skill: precision, control, awareness, presence, experience
    * 1: a beginner: low on both; is safe; they know what that they don't know, they don't risk things; are modest
    * 3: a master: high on skill (confident, grounded; no need to show-off), and a bit lower on risk (slow down)
        * modest, safe: they know that they don't know
        * has seen/experienced injuries, no unnecessary risk and plays within his boundaries/limits (he is aware of and respects)
        * calmed themselves in their eagerness (long journey of doing the impressive/shiny techniques, bored by it, back to the basics)
        * if go faster/higher: first read the ability of the partner (slowly increasing), do it with consent
    * 2: an intermediate: irresponsibly higher risk than skill, the risky ones
        * overly eager (childish enthusiasm), not yet experience with injuries
        * over-estimate their skill (dunning-kruger effect victims); show-off, insecurity, puberty men
        * avoid "risky intermediates": they have not sufficient skill yet and are overly eager, hyper-focused on techniques/lifts; show-offs
* yin/yang extremes
  * extreme masculine:
      * jumping on the partner, instead of pouring; it's not nice, no flow and dangerous (impact; shock to the partner); forcing it
      * domination: grabbing, instead of inviting (for a lift); taking away autonomy (rude), but also not safe; using force
      * overly tensed up; no breathing/relaxation; "closing" the muscles, having them working against you
  * extreme feminine:
      * collapse, being unstable, not grounded, extreme surrender; "just being in the body" (fear of thinking)
      * fully passive, taking no initiative, no conversation happening just a monologue
* anti(dot)-beginner's mistake:
    * saying "no" when he wants to grab-lift me => lower/drop my center, making myself heavy
        * TODO: how do light, small women do that?
    * saying "no" to what is, being true to myself:
        * e.g., with upbeat music and i'm sad/melancholic, i stay slow and sad
        * same with partner: he's fast and risky, I stay being slow and safe
    * use little cheat tricks to compensate for mistakes (aka "kiddie wheels")
        * as flyer, push into base's legs (similar as with shoulder lift, push into upper body)
        * use chicken wings/legs to rebalance
        * basically use leverage and pushing to fix unbalanced position
* "to be in my head", yet again people struggling:
    * what is meant by it? being distracted, unfocused, useless/unproductive thoughts?! (focus/attention on the body happens in the mind...)
        * to have (self)doubt, criticism, unworthy feelings provoking thoughts, insecurity, judgments, dissatisfaction
    * embrace it (don't try to suppress, judge as negative, what must go away, the enemy. to resist is to persist anyway; see christian's sexuality)
        * find the valuable treasure underneath, it wants to tell you something; there are no "bad emotions/thoughts"
    * we need to focus a lot; analyze steps, be aware of what's going on
        * being deliberate means to be safe; to be in the present moment with thoughts and feelings/emotions
        * attention on physical sensations; control; in a relaxed and balanced manner
        * heart & brain (think & feel, men & women, yin & yang), joining, not suppressing one or the other
    * overly thinking? inability to focus! instead, try to focus fiercely on an aspect which is relevant right now.
* how to learn new patterns (and break/free from old ones):
    * have another person manipulate you, send impulses/info to move
* to be able to be controlled/soft (landing; stay relaxed) even though the unexpected happened; that's skill! advanced/mastery
    * often called "accident/mistake"
        * see improvisation acting, how to use it as a source of inspiration instead
        * mistake only if you see it as such; thought/interpretation creates reality
    * in short: how to improvise and deal with the unknown
* the jedi knight skill of knowing (consciously!) where my partner is. his center (of mass), in every given moment.
    * to be able to be there at the moment when needed; he's unbalanced, to support quickly, push him up again.
    * e.g., he falls, and i'll be there, just when needed; expecting it.
        * i keep (consciously!) track, having a visual representation of my partner in my head constantly running
* as an intermediate, using strength to pull someone (acrobatics like), but not a lift, no technique (yet)
* when a new movement (and also generally, anything new in life) feels weird, it might be because it is indeed weird
    * or: it's "because of you" ;) most likely it hasn't habituated yet (or just not compatible?!)
    * it's like learning to drive a car: first effortful ("i'm in my head")
        * later driving while talking, eating, and can't even remember how you got home (automated/autopilot)
    * e.g., when learning new movement pathway, then the focus is on what's usually unnoticed
        * it draws/requires so much attention that no focus left for the dance/partner => push through, just at the beginning
* Learning a new skill requires a sophisticated, well-thought through methodological approach
    * adapted to one's own, individual needs how one's brain likes to learn best (do you know?)
    * "just doing it" will most likely be frustrating or just not fruitful
    * structured/analytical, divide and conquer, slow; acknowledging one's own level (dunning kruger effect)
* a beginner lift: grabbing, forcing it, artificial
    * an advanced lift: it happens through sharing weight, passive for the flyer
    * most importantly: no use of arms/hands (using them, and chicken wings, is usually cheating, and a sign of not properly balanced/centered)
* for advanced/experienced/seasoned practitioner: shu-ha-ri
    * break pathways; grab with hand; manipulate (with hand, leg); target of manipulation: head, neck, center, knees, ...
    * manipulate the other, dare to "grab/push/direct" even the leg or the head, more like "giving impulses"
* dare to give yourself the fear of "being too much"; this is what makes it alive, giving weight
    * same of dancing to deliberately push/manipulate the partner
* center connection, like in real life:
    * A) we haven't found/connected it even to our own center, thus nothing to be connected to
    * B) fear of intimacy (in-to-me-see), deep connection, being seen, truly
        * see the other's pain/suffering (can i hold space for that?) and feeling vulnerable (esp. man-man)
    * C) we go too fast to let things sink, to reach the depth necessary for a real connection
    * D) our "modus operandi" is to stay superficial, all society/environment taught us/habituated us to
* a daoistic principle: "ziran", of its own, by itself
    * let it organically happen, do not interfere with a natural process
    * momentum, gravity, joints, biomechanics
    * a lift and drop of the arm, has its own path, let it do its thing
    * "do nothing, and all will be done"
    * zen/iaido the same: mushin = empty mind
        * you want, you will fail. no intention, not even "not having an intention"-intention
    * exercises about coordination, like rotating arms will not even only be easy, but absolutely effortless
        * to fail is actually effortful as the interference requires effort
        * "how is it possible to not be able to do that?!" you then wonder
* "it's all about (conscious) choice"
    * if it's not a choice, it's not free. going fast-slow, up-down, holding or not, ...
    * being able to be on each edge of the range of each dimension, not out of necessity (because nothing else is possible)
        * but because of a deliberate, conscious, educated, thought through decision (most beneficial option in this context)
* filling space like water, daoism:
    * dare to fall, more than sharing weight, more advanced
    * no conscious decision, no delay, but also no resistance when being pushed away
    * "always trust your partner, and trust yourself more", meaning: being able to catch yourself if necessary, yet fully surrender with a full into your partner
* breaking the pattern usually doesn't feel nice, not about hedonistic pleasure (happy/fun), but about growth
    * "earned pleasure" will come by itself, due to a natural process, not laziness
* dealing with the unexpected (a fall) in a controlled (safe) and energy efficient way
    * using what's there, as a (not only source of inspiration (creativity, improvisation) but) also as an "engine", a driving force
    * like in taijiquan, continuing the pathway, as a slingshot and adding one's own force to it, instead of resisting it (pushing against it)
    * saying "yes, and..." as done in improvisation acting; embracing of what is, whatever there is, even though you might dislike it
* the importance of "shadow-movements" is underestimated
    * the unconscious little adjustments (in the shadow)
    * e.g., to (re)balance quickly, look at the big toe of a person
* "we hire attitude, not skill"
    * a good dance is based on an attitude; patience, mutual listening, collaboration, and seize opportunities when they arise
    * it's not so much about how high and quick someone can be lifted (usually by grabbing and using muscular force/effort)
    * this might look intimidating to the untrained eye, but is shallow and lacks depth
    * skill can be learned quickly, the right attitude takes a life long of practice
* what's the difference between "forcing it" and "making use of possibilities/opportunities/realizing potential"?!
    * when do we cross that line of following a preset plan, and when are we allowing things to emerge by itself?
    * it is not fully passive, it is seeing, realizing, and actively doing (but what's there, not fully generated by oneself)
* when follower experiences hiccups, it's usually the leader's insecurity/lack of confidence what makes the follower experience that
    * in short: it's always the leader's fault ;)
    * although no dedicated leader/follower rules, as long as we have not mastered it completely, we switch sometimes uncommunicatedly into these rules for a moment; sometimes even both lead/follow
* eyes tell a story: into space (not down onto the ground), open and receptive (not dreamy, bleary)
    * even more advanced: look up while flying
* repetition is important!
    * the basic techniques, repeated over and over again, to make it automated, to make it perfect (start slow, then faster; then it will be a choice; be precise, have the read mindset of quality over quantity; put effort, be aware, research, grow, fail)
    * yes, later it will be free, spontaneous (mushin/empty mind), like a jazz player; but he also practiced his scale up and down for hundreds of hours; any professional/skilled person has done his basic training, and as an advanced still is doing it
        * you can't just jump a developmental stage (out of laziness), shu-ha-ri has to be maintained in that order (be patient)
