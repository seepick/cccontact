\section{Sniffing}\label{sec:sniffing}

To start, it's always nice to check some \textbf{videos} (see the Resources chapter at the end of this book), but please don't be intimidated right away from what you are seeing.
The people you will see on those videos are usually already on a very high level, and that's not what you are going to encounter at first.

Join a \textbf{recommended teacher} and go first to some classes (see ``How to spot a good teacher'' further below).
It is not advisable to immediately go to jams, but only after 10--20 classes, to already have the basic principles embodied.
And don't give up if your very first experience seems bad; maybe you want to just try another class or another teacher.
Be also aware that CI is not only physical, so ask yourself: Why and what are you doing?
This will be very beneficial and inspiring for your first steps with CI\@.
