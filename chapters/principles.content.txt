* "rolling point of contact" => rolling contact point
* small-dance guiding talk:
  * standing; butt heavy, relax internal organs down in bowl of pelvis
    * breathe easy; feel weight of arms
    * observe small movements; reflexive actions
    * watch yourself standing
    * shoulder blades heavy, buttocks heavy
  * smallest stretch you can feel, direction of your arms; release; make it smaller, bare initiation
    * go past fingertips
    * where stretch started? arm, shoulder?
  * smallest stretch of your spine; coccyx, sacrum, lumbar, thoracic, cervical, atlas, between ears; release; smaller?!
  * imagine, but don't do it: taking steps, left/right foot
  * feel the movement of the diaphragm
* center of gravity/grounding (heavy, low, abdomen; being the base/underdancer) VS center of levitian/floating (light, high, chest; being the flyer/overdancer)
* WHY small dance:
  * 1. To bring to awareness the unconscoious movement that shape the process of balance.
    * - become more aware; later "unconscious concious"; sensitive awareness; better perception for small movements; survive a fall, where is my body in high velocity; usually done in standing, but can be done in different positions (except lying).
    * - keep the awareness of these shifts also in dance; to compensate weight, predicate weight/movement will come
  * 2. To ground and sensitize your perception
    * - why grounded? otherwise impossible to stay (perceive; psychological element) in the here and now. otherwise can be pushed/moved, turned out oneself easily
  * 3. To feel and relax unnecsesery tension, and to feel what in this sturctre tensegrity holds the architecture of your form.
    * - come to minimum effort/tension, more sensitive (tension masks sensation)
    * - create structure, to be more stable
* small dance (usually still, just listening inside); making it "small dance plus" by using that information as raw material/source and amplify it making it bigger/visible movements
* SMALL DANCE: feel the ground, automatic shifts of weight, subtle auto-movements
  * usually done standing, but it's there in any position, except when lying on the ground
* "SMALL DANCE PLUS": amplify the small-dance sensations (micro-movements), use as a source of inspiration

* SMALL DANCE:
  * being consciously aware of micro movements to keep the body in balance (posture, upright if standing)
  * involuntary, unaware (usually), making it aware is the process of what's called "dancing the small dance"
  * being like a seismograph, sensing tiny eruptions which usually go unnoticed
  * possible to dance the "big dance": tapping into the small dance, use those impulses as a source of inspiration to move
    * making those tiny micro movements bigger, exaggerate them, and let the small dictate the big
  * like trees in the wind (air), like seaweed in the stream (water), not-doing but allowing "it" to do you
  * observing without interfering, like watching your breath
  * unconscious micro-movements/reactions, becoming conscious, aware of them, which keep you balance
    * in any posture, except fully lying down; is that so? how about the head, for example?! maybe 100% indeed only in floating in water...
    * stacking bones, vector going straight down into the earth


* grounded: person's center connected to earth's center; all qualities together (yield, push/pull, reach)
* grounding is NOT heavy! do the shiatsu "find your center". take from taiji. do the competition pushing each other over, circle, enter whoever wants.
* GROUNDING is not contracting muscles; making you stiff; it may feel like stable/robust (grounded), but it's not. easily checked by testing you, by a partner; are you still agile, flexible, can you move? can you breathe freely? groundedness means still being relaxed and soft, surrender, let gravity pull heavy on your body into the floor; it's relaxation (opening), not contraction (closing). yet, easily mixed up, as the sensation might be similar at first. also: with contraction there is some degree of success possible (when the partner pouring his weight onto you), but it has its limitations, it is effortfull, and takes away flexibility/adaptibility, thus ultimate is dangerous.
* breathe!!!! relax, be moveable again. also to co-regulate partner/others in the room.
* SHARING WEIGHT: you are (almost) always too little, and never too much => dare to give more
  * yet, keep amount of pressure constant (measuring newton on point of contact should not change); tricky, thus go slowly
* what is grounding for you? DEFINE it, write it down (it will change continuously anyway)
  * in terms of: weight / attention / intention
* grounding (down, relax, sink, breathe out) VS leaning (off-center, collapsed, plank) VS pushing (contract, stiff, stop breathing)
* grounding (can be up movement) VS heavy (weight, not mass) VS lethargic (collapsed, when tired)
  * 3 different things, subtle differences, but separate (like sharing weight/leaning/pushing difference)
* be strong/firm, yet soft/flexible; relax, breathe out, sink; not contract your  muscles (close them), but go down
  * "to invest into losing", let lose, surrender

* floating VS grounding
  * FLOATING: levitation/center of leviathan, sternum; important "quality" when being lifted
    * not necessarily only up, but away/out(wards) from the center
    * fingers are related to light mass
    * (leviathan was a sea monster, bible, chaos/envy)
  * grounding: center/center of mass; chest/sternum up; base
    * direction down, and inwards/central (bones)
    * center (pelvis) is related with center of mass
    * use IMAGINATION: put center of mass in different body parts
* using quality of grounding/floating is always a useful way to express your yes/no to an invitation to be lifted
* BASE:
  * is alive/active, just like little animal, but now also while standing, with every lift (good gorilla!)
  * when entering, create "valley" (no mountain!); meaning: rotate plane sideways, towards partner, for easier access (launch pad)
    * also when going down, bend knees, so flyer is closer to the ground
* FLYER:
  * POURING weight (very important principle), don't jump (dangerous, big impact on base, and destabilizing)
  * find your center on the base yourself too (don't just be absolutely passive doll)
    * if being lifted on a taller base, make yourself bigger and go a bit on your toes (difficult for base to squad deep)
  * never bend both knees quickly when on base! shock on partner, disbalance, risky! (it's like jumping instead pouring)


GROUNDING
------------------------
* "smart feet": like hands; perceptive and moveable
* with lots of grounding + shared weight => support; much more is possible with it
  * grounding, required for sharing weight, required for pouring weight, required for an elegant lift
  * no need to jump/go on toes, for an elegant=passive lift which "just happens" without forcing it
* why is there no grounding? lots of little elephants...
  * tension, stiff, nervousness, insecurity...
  * how to improve it? how to support your (beginner) partner (non-verbally) to find grounding? ...
  * slow down, exhale audibly, be grounded yourself (inspire)
  * while dancing, help the partner to be more grounded by pushing down, especially on hips
* we usually practice grounding while standing, yet CI has different levels
  * little animal and also a bit higher up, and down to floorwork... totally underrepresented!
* grounding is also about posture; aligned structure, constructing a frame; bone stacking in the direction of an incoming force
* it is also about engaging in the parasympathetic nervous system
* it is intention for lowering the center of mass
  * yet not necessarily literally in space going down (more about relaxing, lowering muscle tonus, "opening the joints")
  * the grounding overly caricatured/sketched is knees bending, downwards
  * BUT: we can also go up, on toes, although much more difficult, yet possible

GROUNDING DEFINITIONS
------------------------
* "more is more":
  * also "rooting" or "earthing", is an elementary/basic, almost therapeutic technique/act/method/process to reach a calm/present/attentative/aware state on the mental, and a firm/stable/strong/robust yet soft on the physical level. through relaxation (minimum force/effort/tension, letting go)/opening/centering/sinking/lowering, a foundation is laid, providing an intra-/inter-connected structure/base/aligned support (usually feet/soles, but any point of contact with the ground), allowing reliability/taking/carrying incoming force and dealing with impact in a more unaffected/indifferent way.
  * it can be achieved by lying down (ground/earth, water, weighted blankets; skin contact, deep&slow massage), barefoot walking, breathing exercises (deep exhale focus), mindfulness practice, etc.
  * the opposite of floating -center of gravitiy vs center of leviathan.
* physical/technical:
  * relaxation of unnecessary muscle tension while maintaining an aligned, supportive structure to carry weight / withstand incoming force.
  * grounding by relaxing (exhale, opening, release) while maintaining structure (otherwise collapse), increasing contact surface, increasing felt pressure on the feet.
* physical/imaginary:
  * feel like gravity is pulling on every single cell of your body downwards.
  * while it pulls you down, you push yourself up, like a spring wanting to go up while you push it down, or a ball you push under the water.
  * like sucking into the soil, growing roots, melting, merging with it, becoming one, like a tree.
  * physical/narrative:
  like a big ball hanging from your pelvis (between genitals and anus), the one's from the big clocks, pulling on your spine, while your legs are like firm hard-rubber.
  * while you move, that ball is almost not moving, but keeps being pulled down towards the center of the earth, your body maintaining it's firm-springy-quality, like bamboo.
* psychological:
  * although being exposed to difficulties, staying calm and centered, not losing one's grip; almost like maintaining one's smile while being slapped in the face.
  * not really indifferent, still aware and connected of what's happening, but "less fucks given", and accepting with courage what is, taking it with heroic stability.
* universal:
  * maintaining stability and one's center, not giving in to external forces, yet without stiffness but with controlled relaxation (relax, not collapse).

* PATHWAY continuation:
  * allowing for smoothness/fluidity, give predictability, otherwise dance perceived as bumpy and not trustworthy (unexpected!)
  * basic principles often violated by beginners, esp. breaking the pathway (continuation)
    * insecure? front part avoidance? or...?
    * use arms (to change the direction), easier not to interrupt
    * turn from horizontal to vertical spiral/plane
* without grounding there is nothing, no foundation, nothing to build upon
* breathing, breathing, breathing -a constant reminder, useful

* rolling "point" of contact
  * can also be multiple ones, points
  * can also be a surface area
  * yet, usually try to be "pointy", by bugling out, a clearer communication established
  * more than 2 points: several information streams at the same time, very advanced; keeping track of them
* "going fast is easy, going slow is difficult"
  * fast, mistakes can easily by covered up/masked; being off balance
  * slow, needs way more control
  * slow is everything zoomed in; the small hickups will be huge/visible
  * our fast mentality, expressed through movement
  * when you can do it slowly, you can do it fast

 * sensitivity (=the ability to listen) requires gentleness/softness. softness is minimum effort/tensions, min. engagement of muscle fibres
   * a higher-resolution of neuro-muscular connection. precision: 82% vs 82.3% of activation (tension). like kink-spanking: being able to hit with 40% vs 45%, to slowly expand the comfort zone. otherwise: danger, risk of injury, going too fast, breaking boundary, breaking a person, or at least a bone.
* too much wanting, forcing it. not enough openness, improvisation; being and listening what the moment want to unfold, letting yourself be surprised without anticipation.
* closing your yes is very much different; more perception, sensory capacity shifts from visual to tactile (like blind people hear more)
  * now try to move your head: losing sense of orientation (where's up/down), play with it (if you dare)
* small dance: usually from regular standing, but also possible in any position (exception when fully relaxed lying down); search for the unstable/unbalanced position, to amplify it (the wobblying, the shaking)
  * even during walking able to sense, short moment when one-legged, a subtle shake, that's it.
* spiral: actually helix; be precise ;)
* "fast can be fun (and risky, and superficial), slow can lead to depth (heightened sensation, even intimacy), yet a pause leads to magic"
* develop smart feet, making no sounds, soft and controlled
* ad motto: if you dont fall, you are doing something wrong. growth is about (controlled) failure, not success. find your limits, explore, and expand them.
- principle (grammar/abstract concept) vs technique (vocabulary/concrete manifestation)
- order of skills to acquire at the beginning: breathe - relax - balance - ground - share weight - pour weight - rolling contact - lift
- pouring weight
  - obviously possible to do it onto another person, in a duo; shifting my own weight gradually into his
  - but also solo possible: shifting the weight left/right leg
    - have the image of the pelvis being a bowl, pouring water back-forth, slowly
      - don't engage the leg muscles, don't push; but let gravity pull you passively
* ad motto: shu-ha-ri
  * shu: follow rule, beginner: 0-5 years; you don't know anything, and you know that; you are supposed to blindly follow your master, as you won't understand anyway the why; trust, have endurance
  * ha: break rule, intermediate: 5-15 years; the longest phase, testing your own skills, dangerous, usually over-estimation; bit of understanding of the reasons behind the rules; occasionally breaking them with high risk (injury)
  * ri: become rule, master: 15+ years; deep experiencial embodiment of all the rules and principles; many accidents/injuries; he can do the forbidden stuff/black magic, knowing that in this specific case the consequences are minimal/non-existing
  * watch out for dunning kruger effect; most intermediate overestimate themselves
    * there are no shortcuts, you have to go through the long and hard work which comes with the intermediate state, and not jump directly to the master state; ego-arrogance, eagerness, impatience.
  * ad motto: "you can do whatever you want, as long as you know what you're doing"
  * understand the rule, then you can find deliberate choice to "defuse" them
* ad motto: aurelius: "life's a wrestle, not a dance"
* rolling point of contact (rpoc), also on the ground. smoothing rolling, no edges, no (sudden) bumps, no sounds. curves, round. maintaining momentum/trajectory, pathway. beginners bump, with partner and with ground, but on ground more magnified/visible.
* grounding mistake: over-tensing, stiff legs, partner will feel lots of little impacts in his body-system, "hard steps"
  * be strong yet soft (chinese: jing > li)
* RPoC (rolling point of contact)
  * do it with the ground, with your feet, having "smart feet", soft rolling down, on the balls/front first (not heel)
    * e.g. jump and land without a sound
    * e.g. when going down from a lift, land first toes
  * think of how cars were built: 50 years ago very rigid; today very soft
    * creating more time to slow down to zero, taking away kinetic energy (lowering the impact) and transfer it into the deformation process
    * this change in thinking (safety through rigidity) has saved unbelievable many lives since then
  * RPoC requires wave patterns; bulging out
    * to land softly with feet, "going down in a wave"
  * as a base, to enable flyer to land softly
    * 1) go down, lowering your center, bending knees
    * 2) create a diagonal ramp, tilt the pelvis/torso sideways to slide him down
    * 3) stay in contact once flyer touches the ground; don't disappear too quickly; give lots of oomph/support, push into him so they can slowly+softly transition/shift weight
    * in general: slow down, give much oomph, be controlled and sensitive/listening
    * maybe even push up, e.g. support the flyer's leg by pulling it up slightly (watch out to not bring him in risky situation by grabbing his landing gear)
      * push up against gravitational pull, "making him light"
* ad smalldance: quote: "Being still and doing nothing are two completely different things" (jackie chan)
* principles revisited: grounding, sharing weight, RPoC, center connection (self and others), pouring weight, mushin (new one!)
* it IS possible to have a rolling point of contact while on the floor with the pelvis; need to be super relaxed though
* the base/foundation/essence: balance/grounding
    * no falling but pouring, no little elephants but "smart feet" (soft, controlled)
* pathway continuation + rolling point of contact:
    * principles to adhere almost dogmatically (100% perfect)
        * also from a pragmatic perspective: it's practical, it's smoother, more fluid/fluent, continuous, round...
    * only break it, if you can stay with it 100% (again: a conscious choice = freedom = mastery)
    * skill, precision, awareness, knowledge (of those principles), control, softness
* 2 wrong ways of grounding:
    * 1: through a lethargic drop, collapsing the structure; it's not stable, it's just heavy and immovable
    * 2: through overly tensing up, contraction; "closing" the muscles; the illusion of grounding as it feels firm, but it's stiff and immovable too
        * common mistake also in taijiquan: the illusion of grounding by excessive use of force (YANG)
        * contracting, closing (immobile, unstable); instead of relaxing/sinking/dropping into the center (surrender, trust; YIN)


--------------------------------------------------------
CENTERING
* center (a location) / centering (verb, process of) / centered (state, positioned in)
* free associations: alignment, posture, stability, balanced, weight, stacking, proximal, awareness, space dimensions, calibration/adjustment, concentrated
* in construction: "a temporary structure to support a permanent structure (bridges/arches"
* psychologically: connected with oneself, calm emotions, slow breath, heightened sensitivity/perception, peace within chaos)
    * centering through breathing, gratitude/love, mindfulness, metta meditation (ACT), self-care
* being in the present moment, healthy coping mechanisms
* martial arts: act from a stable place (not lean out of the window too far, doing more than capable; staying true)
* definition: the process of shifting one's attention to a specific body part (usually more proximal)
    * more about attention (inwards)
    * where to put the center of attention (a specific body part, like hand, not necessarily dantien/hara/center of mass)
        * as if the ego-self awareness is not behind eyes but in that specific part
* shared center of mass becomes a single center: when 2 physical objects lean on each other, they have 1 center
--------------------------------------------------------
CENTERING - and others
* grounding + pelvis (?)
* centering vs. GROUNDING:
    * first center, then ground
    * grounding is different from centering
        * grounding is about: content who we are, confidence, certainty, minimum effort
        * grounding through: walk barefoot, earthy teas, regular physical activity, saying "no", self-reflect
        * grounding is (figuratively speaking): when human's center is connected to earth's center
    * center of mass is focused like in the center of a circle; grounding goes downwards into the floor
    * newton's 3rd law of motion: if two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions
        * i ground onto the earth, pushing with my mass (down), the earth pushes against (up). the earth pulls me down, and i her up (a tiny bit).
    * grounding as a specific instance of centering; which is: towards the feet, lowered into the floor/ground
    * through grounding => centering, through centering => core (connection)
* centered vs. BALANCED:
    * centered: more about intention
    * balanced: more physical (physiological, mechanical) thing
    * off-balanced... off-center.
    * balance: when the center is within "area of control" (like a 3D spot, the center, is within 2D plane on the ground)
* APPROACH: provocative questions to explore definitions/validity:
    * "can there be X without Y, and vice versa?"
    * use examples, answer intuitively, then extract/filtrate criteria/essence; conclude definition
--------------------------------------------------------
* "empty mind" principle
    * in japanese culture: mushin
    * being able to surprise yourself, not forcing, not (overly) wanting
    * yet, also not totally passive; lethargically lying on your bed doing nothing
    * but: to seize opportunity when it reveals itself, instantly, without a daily, as there is some sort of constant (relaxed, effortless) readiness
    * the mind-body is active and awake, not sleepy-dreamy
