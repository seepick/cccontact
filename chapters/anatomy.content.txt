ABOUT
============================
* terminology/anatomy: muscles, bones, movement
* physiology, functional-anatomy/bio-mechanics
* muscle (filament) theory (myosin-actin); ATP
* also relevant injuries (pathology)
* a bit medicine/biology

CONTENT
============================
* you have been swimming in gravity since the day you were born. every cell knows where down is. easily forgotten. your mass and the earth's mass calling to each other.
* spherical space; mass of the body, weight, water... we're 70% water
  * body's prime sense of its own 3-dimensionality
* orientation; we know space and our relation to it via the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear
  * if spin until dizzy, feels like a turning world after stopped spinning; sensation not felt in the inner ear though!
    * instead, stance/stomach will be affected
  * like in an aerospace spinning chair, head slightly side-ways, stimulating forward/back aspect of semicircular canals and acceleration
    * when stop now, sensation of being shot forward, although sitting still in chair; flying body and at the same time sitting body
  * both no inner ear sensation, simply whole body flying, with fear and adrenalin; great; nice phantom experience
* there are 26 human senses (J.J. Gibson, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems)
  * it's difficult to find out what we don't know
* other senses: constant variations; incidents, shifts, modulations, silences/blinks.
  * gravity just keeps on attracting
  * any variation, comes from each element in its field, including ourselves
* ad common mistakes:
    * 1 foot 2 feet.
    * foot not leg. hand not arm.
    * among others: stomach not belly.
    * foot/feet/feets, one feet (same with "not stomach, but belly/frontside"
* muscle fibers (big/medium/small ones, innervening)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception
* "box" = torso basically; "ships" = shoulder and hips (connected, moveable in all 3 dimensions/planes)
* pelvic/shoulder girdle (see pelvis notes for workshop; wikipedia article)
* 5 senses plus: balance (vestibular sense), body position (proprioception), movement (kinesthesia); and: pain (nociception), temperature (thermoception); ... many more
* check that the word "tonality" is explained (=muscle tension)
* write more about anatomy, vestibular/inner ear
* processus spinosus - part of spine bulging out (protrusion), when you do a roll wrong
* idea: small chapter about basic injuries (after quick intro into tissue and stuff), like dislocation, hematome; what it is, how it might happen, and how to treat it (movement/stillness, taping, warmth/cold, massage, ...)
* HOMO- VS CONTRA-lateral
  * contra-lateral (opposite side): natural way of walking; exaggerate by doing a "catwalk" (swing arms, move shoulder blades/pelvis)
  * homo-lateral (same side): walking like a "penguin" (not to confuse with uni/bi-lateral)
* advanced stuff
  * biomechanical engineering concept: tensegrity (tension integrity)
    * not muscle+bones, but connective-tissue + bones
  * "box" is area between ships (shoulders + hips)
  * add muscle contraction  (sarcomeres, myosin/actin)
  * (many people don't know the word) tonality: we have a default (usual unconscious) level of muscle tension; we have a range to be able to play within
* movements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boNlEYQ5M5c
* pelvis movements terminology; tilting, rotating (like with simple joints flex/ext, abd/add, pro/retr, elev/depr). be very clear/deliberate and precise/technical. slowly add complexity by combining planes/movements.
  * "core" is more than just rectus abdominis (and transv/obliques). it's all what's connected to the spine. also back. also legs. latissimus, etc...
  * tensegrity model.
* the "core" is not only the abs (4 abdominal layers of muscles), way more: all the muscles that are connected to the spine! so also the back, upper legs, etc...
* research "muscle memory"
* research term "homologous"
* ad anatomy: feet vs foot; stomach vs belly


PELVIS
--------------------------------------------------------
* plural: pelves OR pelvises
* look up a picture of a pelvis: almost shaped like an elephant with huge ear rings; sacrum being the head, nose the coccyx
* pelvis region: part between abdomen and thighs
    * bony pelvis (=pelvic skeleton):
        * sacrum and coccyx (=pelvic spine) at the back
        * anteriorly/lateral pair of hip bones
    * pelvic bones (=pelvic girdle):
        * ilium: upper part, big, the ears
        * ischium: lower-outer part of ear ring
        * pubis: upper-inner part of earring
* pelvic floor: below pelvic cavity; function: 1) keep organs up 2) control openings
* perineum (=pelvic diaphragm): below pelvic floor
* pelvic brim: plane/line between sacrum & public symphysis
* pelvic cavity: 1) greater/false above brim, 2) lesser/false below brim
* muscles: obturator int/ext, piriformis, iliacus + psoas, tensor fasciae latae, glutei, gemellus sup/inf, quadratus femoris, adductors
* the "whole" in the bones of the lower part: obturator foramen; functions:
    * 1: weight reduction; strong and light
    * 2: passage/protection for nerves/vessels
    * 3: muscle attachment site (obturator int/ext, hip stabilization/rotation, balance/mobility)
* pelvis = an integrated mechanical system, based on "tensegrity icosahedron" (polyhedron with 20 faces)
    * able to withstand omnidirectional forces; low-energy requiring system; favored by natural selection
* SIJ = Sacroiliac joint; very strong, supports whole upper body weight
* "obstetrical dilemma": locomotion efficiency VS birth canal width
    * women already at max possible width; men more optimized for bipedal locomotion
--------------------------------------------------------

* it's very useful to use some anatomy (not in its most details though)
    * especially functional anatomy (movements, biomechanics) for body workers/dancers/sports/teachers/etc
    * otherwise, you will stay semi-professional at maximum...

SENSATION & PERCEPTION
* see crash course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWnZvXJH2o
    * sensation: bottom-up process by which our senses, like vision/hearing/smell, receive and relay outside stimuli (conduction)
    * perception: the top-down way our brains organize and interpret that information and put it into context
    * they are connected but separate!
    * signal detection theory: how people can detect weak stimuli (threshold)
    * sensory adaption: like habituation (not feeling underwear)
    * weber's law: we perceive differences on a logarithmic, not linear scale
        * 1 kg of pressure, we feel 0.2 kg difference; but with 100 kg pressure, we can only feel 5 kg difference (not 0.2 kg anymore)
        * not an amount of change, but a percentage, that matters
    * if we want to dance with maximum attentiveness, we need to be very light (yet center connected, to convey information from the whole body; finding the sweetspot there)
    * for peripheral vision, we use our rods (also gray scale, at night); cones only for high lid conditions and color
* homunkulus
