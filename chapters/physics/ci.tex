\section{Relation to CI}\label{sec:relation-to-ci}

We constantly encounter those concepts during practicing CI: When our bodies --which are basically also just physical objects-- are in motion, they have a certain momentum, which they want to keep (inertia) until a force is acted upon them.
Gravity pulls us downwards, and we can use levers to take advantage of it, without having the need to exert lots of muscular force, wasting our energy and making the practice effortful, instead of effortless.
Keeping track of the trajectory of moving objects helps us to keep a continuous pathway, making the movements more smooth, and less edgy/clumsy, but also more predictable for our partner, thus resulting in an increased level of trust and more fun.
