- my personal teacher's dialect: slow, flowy, oppositional to oldschool CI (dynamic, explosive, risky, survival); deep, more continuous center connection, constant rolling contact
* my background: martial arts and somatic movement (anything more conscious, slow and precise); exploration of movement and touch; solo and partnered
* 1/3rd my own experience/thought/observations 1/3rd from teachers i experienced directly, from peers and 1/3rd from people i never met directly, internet or on paper
