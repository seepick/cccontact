Physics is a huge and fascinating science, dealing with the big (astronomy, astrophysics), the small (nuclear and particle physics), the universal (electromagnetism, thermodynamics) and the more complicated (quantum physics, relativity); basically how the universe behaves, or at least how matter moves through space and time as well as energy and force.

For our purpose though, we will focus on \textbf{classical physics}, mechanics to be precise and its sub-branches, the fundamental concepts of time, space and how they give rise to higher phenomena encountered during CI, and we won't go into the realm of quantum physics as this is beyond the human perception and not of any use to us.
An understanding of physics isn't really needed though --to use it, to play with it-- as it doesn't actually help on a perceptual/experiential, bodily level.

In CI, we engage in the exploration of physics, to play with physical forces, with the direction of movement and its changes in space.
It might be interesting though to see what you learned in physics, to see what's yet \textbf{embodied}.
Engineers might smile hearing terminology from the world of leverage, friction, mutual point of contact, center of mass and so on.
Preferably, after that chapter you are also familiar with terms such as gravity, vector, inertia, force, momentum, and kinetics.
