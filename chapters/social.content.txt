ABOUT
* inter-personal; everything which has to do with "the other" (floor, single partner, big body/group, society at large)
* social behavior, consent/intimacy
* the connection with the other; engage/disengage a dance

CONTENT

* rules when sharing in the circle. content. duration. why you share, benefit for others. speak slowly, connect to others, look. dont overshare, frequency.
* discomfort in proxmity; for women: breasts, rolling over the front top; for men: penis, roling over front lower; same-sex partner usually more comfortable with
* not only guidelines/recommendations for circle sharing, but also when 1on1 sharing. empathy, listen. talk about yourself, your own experience. never diagnose the other (you are too much of something), even if well intended and you think you are right (and the other one wrong). if wanna correct the other, ask for permission first (healthy feedback culture).
* the floor (ground) is always a partner as well
  * a duo is actually a trio (2 people + 1 floor)
  * consciously decide depth with floor/partner
* own section trios+
* social aspect:
    * hygiene: good smells, fresh shirts; showered, but not intense scents!
    * during jam: we approach each other, ask for a dance (verbally or non-verbally); might helps if before have a bit of eye contact; feel free to say yes or no, both is welcome; stop the dance if you feel like so, there are no obligations.
    * start slowly with a new/unknown partner; very basic, check principles; slowly start with more techniques and see where your partner is, how far you can go with him; go through a mental checklist, building it up, and sketch a picture of his skills, where he is, and don't push/force too much what's not possible.
* how to start a dance... yes, definitely eye contact can help sometimes if not clear (some people maybe don't see you, or are too shy to accept the invitation of dancing in negative space); look in eyes, smile, approach, mirror. now totally clear
* choice of partner: male/female balance. old/young. much diversity helps you to grow. and allow yourself your favorites, depending on your capacity to work vs just enjoy. observe your patterns in choices, comfort zone, maybe extend it. also whether you go for it, or let yourself be chosen. do/try the opposite.
* the art of giving feedback:
    * how to give feedback to your partner/s during exercise/dance.
    * in our community, we give honest feedback, talk things through
    * always check where it comes from: want to genuinely help to get better? or push down, express your frustration?
    * positive/constructive feedback (nice, i liked it, well done, great progress) is always welcome; negative feedback (improvements) ask for permission, check whether other is open to receive it
    * formulate questions instead of commands: "how about...", "can we try..."
    * own experience can be the best teacher; switch roles, and try to demonstrate yourself (show how good you actually do it yourself, hehe)
    * have/show understanding/compassion; be kind and soft; be supportive, be patient, encouraging ("you can do that")
        * suggest taking smaller steps (literally), slow down, dissect; somehow take away complexity
    * don't criticize him, don't tell what they are doing wrong
        * don't let your own inner critic also affect your partner
        * when in doubt: say nothing (reden ist silber, schweigen ist gold)
        * ego, wanting to show its superiority?! that's a sign of weakness, those who are unable to give to those in need; scarcity vs abundance mentality; there's enough love for all of us, it doesn't divide, it multiplies
    * maybe use qualities, such as: tense, slow, tender, fast-paced, ... more neutral terms, yet subjective (own experience)
    * when there are conflicting opinions, curiously explore and research both possibilities; ultimately ask the teacher, as he should know a bit better usually ;)
    * we are all here to practice, we are all beginners and want to learn, and we still do mistakes, so do you; some of us are more soft-skinned/insecure, you'll destroy them; your self-harshness can stay inside, don't do to others
* "find a partner" - something which can pose a challenge for some, sometimes; something in "regular" dance classes is much easier: "one to the left" ;)
* egalitarian: sooo nice + special about CI (and only very few dances out there; not only men/leader and women/follower let go, and not where it being switched, but no roles assigned at all)
    * as a strong (heavy) men, "finally i can feel like a woman, surrender to him, being taken care of, let go"
    * feel free to manipulate/lead, it's enjoyable as a receiver; that clarity feels great
    * the difference in experience/psycho-dynamics between MMF and MFF for example
* sense the center of your partner. why?
    * to connect yours with theirs. to use this connection for lifts. to put your center onto theirs. to only give weight into that center into the ground (otherwise push the partner off-balance). the only way to safely share weight.
* how to dance with a beginner as an advanced?
    * don't tell, but inspire; be a role-model and lead by example
    * convey the basics through the dance (grounding, push them gently, making it clear; sharing weight by leaning gently, gradually; rolling point of contact and slight force into pathway continuation)
    * be patient, go slow; don't get frustrated (you too started once, how would you have been liked to be treated; or when you join another dance class in a different style/school?!)
    * if nothing works: talk, use words; even more needed: take a break, create adhoc-examples; always compliment them of improvements (nicely done, great, good)
    * if yet nothing works; enjoy what is (and focus less on what there isn't)
* how to dance with an advanced as a beginner?
    * TODO
* how to dance the unwanted dance?
    * if your partner goes way too fast, is insensitive, seems to have inappropriate intentions, smells bad, ... TODO
* kinesthetic resonance... TODO: some research about it; sense the other ('s center), peripheric vision; empathy/mirror neurons, ... e.g. contagious yawning; one leans back, the other too (sympathy)
    * kinesthetic resonance: kind of empathy, mirror neurons, "i see you, thus i feel you"; your tension becomes mine (like yawning, irresistible!)
      * speed syncs, we do it consciously or unconsciously (whether we want it or not, difficult to resist); like instruction to sense center of partner
      * like the "jedi skill" while walking: unconscious processing of information and responding to it
        * feeling the result, which simple-minded people call "energy" or assign some metaphysical-esoteric-supernatural phenomenon to it

* to mirror the partner (movement, "energy", quality), to do otherwise feels like betrayal; the disconnect


\section{Partner Dance}\label{sec:partner-dance}

\textit{Disclaimer}: There is lots to tell about dancing with one (or more) partner(s), and this subsection will be far from mentioning all the most relevant there is, but ought to give just a quick glimpse of what might be encountered at the beginning of your CI journey.

Humans are \textbf{social animals}, and as such we have countless neuronal networks dedicated to processing social information, hardwired bonding tendencies leading to the ability to read each other, get in-tuned with each other, ultimately leading to harmony in groups.
Think of basic empathy, which is associated to mirror neurons in our brain, which for example leads us to yawn once we see someone else yawning, or feel the pain we observe in that funny (?) video clip where someone falls from a skateboard.
If we want to feel how someone else is feeling, we might simply want to put our full presence with that person (or even a group) and feel inside our bodies of what's happening; there is a high chance that what we experience is the other person's state of being.
Using a more ``flowery language'', we could say that this is the ability of ``\textit{feel the other person's energy}'' --whatever is supposed to be meant by (mis-)using the word ``energy'' here.

As human beings we also have the innate need to \textbf{be seen} by others; being ignored as one of the worst punishments we can experience, leading to feelings of isolation, exclusion and loneliness.
The biggest present therefore we can give each other is to \textbf{mirror} each other's movements; explicitly acknowledging the other person's existence, putting one's attention to that person, copying his movements, which is also called ``\textit{kinesthetic resonance}''.
Of course counter-mirroring has the same effect (you go down, I go up; you go left, I go right), as it still maintains a form of connection we can play with.




* read people's moving style: says something about/it's based on their past life experiences, their background (dance, acrobatic, ... + how to spot those), personality in general (trust/fear, confidence, self-esteem, easygoing, dare to risk/safe-unsafe risky/courageous, ok to fail/explore/research or play it safe, intimate/distant...), mood today (energy level, emotional state), obviously CI experience/skill
* to find a (potential) dance partner (or join a duo?): make yourself noticeable by dancing in their negative space, like an accordion going in and out, don't stick too close all the time, give space
* be present with your partner, like in the army, got each other's backs; we re-lie on each other, save him when needed, be a team, together (don't break your partner, you won't get another one). the satisfying feeling when you were there when he needed you, almost fell; the quick response, surprising yourself; the feeling of being needed, being of use.
* as a good exercise partner (the passive part), you are very actively engaged about what is being done; you observe your partner where he is, what he needs, see his deficiencies and encourage his possibilities (potential), you anticipate a useful scenario where he can grow (proximal zone of development), when there was the slightest improvement compliment saying something simple as "nice"; serve him, be a little teacher
* how to start a dance?
    * same for joining a single or an existing duo...
    * first dance in proximity, dance negative space.
        * usually no eye contact, but sometimes it helps, and then definitely smile, it makes you more likeable/trustworthy.
        * NEVER approach people from the back (they can't see you) and especially NEVER touch right away; no possibility for consent there
    * WAIT - so they are aware of your presence and intention.
    * be attentative to response of you; are they moving towards or away from you?
    * if towards: do some "grasing", backs of arms. usually start back2back.
    * if away: also retreat, respect the people's no, and preferably not take it personally (it might be, but you don't know)
        * recover, shake it off, and try again
        * if you really dare, you can ask the people afterwards about what happened, and how they interpreted it; ask for feedback, what you could have done differently (different approaching, take a shower, change behavior); use it to improve, not to push yourself down.
* guide how to dis/engage a dance: mirror the person, bit eye contact, finger/hand touch, back2back; disengage namaste/hug, use water drinking as excuse, say thank you and roll away
DIS/ENGAGE:
* the FIRST DANCE, on an interpersonal level:
  * getting to know each other. start super slow and easy.
  * ASK questions (sending a clear and deliberate signal, e.g. manipulate or a clear dominate/active or submissive/passive move, offering/requesting a lift) and be super perceptive/susceptible for the answer (receiving a clear yes or no, thus inferring your partner's personality/preferences/dislikes)
  * it's like romantic relationships:
    * don't go too fast, don't over-invest in the beginning because you are super enthusiastic
    * instead be APPROPRIATE and PROPORTIONAL to what is (at the beginning very little, and build up over time)
    * check each other out, and let go of any prejudgments you might have, and empty yourself, free yourself, and let yourself be surprised.
  * even a small HANDSHAKE can reveal so much about the other person
  * how to start a dance: to make it clear/explicit: although usually not common, make eye contact (+smile) for a short moment
* the "other end" of starting a dance = ENDING it
  * make it clear, be honest and direct (matter of respect); e.g. namaste sign, say "thank you", or just "i prefer not to dance with you because ..." (moving too fast, i don't feel safe; i have a need for...)
    * feel free to give honest feedback, how else should we learn; we also would like to hear our mistakes so we can improve on them, instead of falsely believing we are flawless perfect beings in every aspect
  * don't use excuses, don't lie (e.g. have to drink some water), as otherwise people will come back to you (misunderstanding => conflict)
  * it's much about consent/safety, to do it right
  * after having disengaged, "shake it off" (arms or whole body), literally (physically) but also figuratively (psychologically)
    * sometimes, a quick body shake can be enough, to continue; like ginger in-between to neutralize the taste
    * intention to clear oneself from your "partner's energy", to reset, start fresh
* how to build trust? pattern continuation principle: predictability, thus trust
  * also rolling of point contact principle: predictability, no "extreme octopus" (like from ecstatic dance, expression of chaos, no clarity, no trust)

* sex differences: men are stiff, women are unstable.
  * men+men: afraid of intimacy (homophobia?), competition? little softness to surrender, more (play-)fighting
  * men+women: no egalitarian anymore, clear (social-stereotypical) rules (many (smaller) women are lifted against their will, grabbed; THAT's AN ISSUE!!!)
  * as a big guy: not being lifted at all (if dance only/mostly with women); then more like typical lead/follow roles
* giving feedback: how else shall we learn/grow/improve? how to do it?
  * especially if i dislike something: smell, too fast, not listening, insensitive, ...
  * sometimes we don't know, so please tell, to be aware and have at least a chance to change.
  * how to say "no" to an invitation (in negative space; no surprise to partner immediately jump to touch!), during the dance (stopping it)
  * is the "investment" worth it, to tell people?
    * is it short-term then maybe not; like educating tourists about them being unaware of traffic; too many of them, and gone in a day again
    * is it long-term; an ongoing class, then yes
      * you'll see them many times, so you will benefit from it)
      * is it even changeable: smell, then change shirt/shower or is it his face, because surgery maybe not going to happen
  * psychological plane:
    * triggers, projections; something is touching our own values (cultural differences, mostly unaware; we differ, but there are no absolutes)
    * judgments (negative and positive ones)... own them, express and not suppress.
* different personality, different preferences:
  * dance by yourself/solo, distance with others, with dedicated partner, trio, group
  * easy-goingness with touch and intimacy (roll over front-side)
  * groundedness = calm, safe, confident, trust
  * fast/slow, cold/firey
* finding a partner: can be tricky for some. sociometer/popularity thing, being liked/belonging; also male/female tension, desire, the thought of "is it allowed?"
* starting a dance (once partner is already assigned):
  * begin with negative space first, important! don't go in contact right away
  * to "warm up", like a foreplay, to get attuned to each other, synchronize, align, to agree to a style
  * otherwise, it will be more bumpy and difficult "to find each other"
* correct your partner non-verbally as much as possible
  * only if not working, then use words, say something (keep it short though, single word; like "breathe" or "ground" or "slow")
  * e.g. grounding => push them, if just moving away, push vertical (ground them; push pelvis)
  * e.g. pathway breaking => use a bit more force/insist on the trajectory
  * e.g. stiff => speed up; e.g. wobbly/unstable => slow done
* dancing with a new/unknown partner; checking them out first: their skill & quality
  * for safety reason as well! not only to attune/sync each other, to improve the dance
  * e.g. don't fall into them, lean, off balance, otherwise both will fall; as partner without grounding can't support, unstable

* the magic moment when "dancing with the big body"; dancing with everybody, secretly (without them knowing); feeling connected, belonging (spiritual practice?!)
* why do we depersonalize the dance partner? isn't it devaluing?
* ad tantric distance: does it mean the partner is constantly in our bed?!
* soft skills: social (start/end/join a dance), boundary/consent is important!
* ad FEEDBACK:
  * feedback is pure data, without judgment (neutral). like a thermostat.
    * see in soccer, when a kid is playing by itself. it doesn't need a coach, because he gets immediate feedback by seeing whether the ball is in or not. also if not, which direction its too far, and can adjust. learning made easy.
    * just reflect objective facts, but avoid interpreting anything.
    * it might be within or not the given exercise.
  * when saying "you did good/bad" we focus on the relational/psychological aspect, which disturbs the learning process. there is an emotional part, which is bigger the closer the person is to us. "where there is light, there is shadow": when we say its good, and the next time we don't say it, it might be considered bad.
* also address issue of men being overly sexual (a dating place?); human urges, unwanted behaviors; also women's inability to express (feel/know?) boundaries (freeze)
