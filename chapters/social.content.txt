ABOUT
========================================================================
* inter-personal; everything which has to do with "the other" (floor, single partner, big body/group, society at large)
* psychological
* social behavior, consent/intimacy
* the connection with the other; engage/disengage a dance
* partner exercises/dance (trios)
* behavior in classes/workshops (in bigger groups)
* space awareness (room, and all the people in it; big body)

CONTENT
========================================================================
* rules when sharing in the circle. content. duration. why you share, benefit for others. speak slowly, connect to others, look. dont overshare, frequency.
* discomfort in proxmity; for women: breasts, rolling over the front top; for men: penis, roling over front lower; same-sex partner usually more comfortable with
* not only guidelines/recommendations for circle sharing, but also when 1on1 sharing. empathy, listen. talk about yourself, your own experience. never diagnose the other (you are too much of something), even if well intended and you think you are right (and the other one wrong). if wanna correct the other, ask for permission first (healthy feedback culture).
* the floor (ground) is always a partner as well
  * a duo is actually a trio (2 people + 1 floor)
  * consciously decide depth with floor/partner
* own section trios+
* social aspect:
    * hygiene: good smells, fresh shirts; showered, but not intense scents!
    * during jam: we approach each other, ask for a dance (verbally or non-verbally); might helps if before have a bit of eye contact; feel free to say yes or no, both is welcome; stop the dance if you feel like so, there are no obligations.
    * start slowly with a new/unknown partner; very basic, check principles; slowly start with more techniques and see where your partner is, how far you can go with him; go through a mental checklist, building it up, and sketch a picture of his skills, where he is, and don't push/force too much what's not possible.
* how to start a dance... yes, definitely eye contact can help sometimes if not clear (some people maybe don't see you, or are too shy to accept the invitation of dancing in negative space); look in eyes, smile, approach, mirror. now totally clear
* choice of partner: male/female balance. old/young. much diversity helps you to grow. and allow yourself your favorites, depending on your capacity to work vs just enjoy. observe your patterns in choices, comfort zone, maybe extend it. also whether you go for it, or let yourself be chosen. do/try the opposite.
* the art of giving feedback:
    * how to give feedback to your partner/s during exercise/dance.
    * in our community, we give honest feedback, talk things through
    * always check where it comes from: want to genuinely help to get better? or push down, express your frustration?
    * positive/constructive feedback (nice, i liked it, well done, great progress) is always welcome; negative feedback (improvements) ask for permission, check whether other is open to receive it
    * formulate questions instead of commands: "how about...", "can we try..."
    * own experience can be the best teacher; switch roles, and try to demonstrate yourself (show how good you actually do it yourself, hehe)
    * have/show understanding/compassion; be kind and soft; be supportive, be patient, encouraging ("you can do that")
        * suggest taking smaller steps (literally), slow down, dissect; somehow take away complexity
    * don't criticize him, don't tell what they are doing wrong
        * don't let your own inner critic also affect your partner
        * when in doubt: say nothing (reden ist silber, schweigen ist gold)
        * ego, wanting to show its superiority?! that's a sign of weakness, those who are unable to give to those in need; scarcity vs abundance mentality; there's enough love for all of us, it doesn't divide, it multiplies
    * maybe use qualities, such as: tense, slow, tender, fast-paced, ... more neutral terms, yet subjective (own experience)
    * when there are conflicting opinions, curiously explore and research both possibilities; ultimately ask the teacher, as he should know a bit better usually ;)
    * we are all here to practice, we are all beginners and want to learn, and we still do mistakes, so do you; some of us are more soft-skinned/insecure, you'll destroy them; your self-harshness can stay inside, don't do to others
* "find a partner" - something which can pose a challenge for some, sometimes; something in "regular" dance classes is much easier: "one to the left" ;)
* egalitarian: sooo nice + special about CI (and only very few dances out there; not only men/leader and women/follower let go, and not where it being switched, but no roles assigned at all)
    * as a strong (heavy) men, "finally i can feel like a woman, surrender to him, being taken care of, let go"
    * feel free to manipulate/lead, it's enjoyable as a receiver; that clarity feels great
    * the difference in experience/psycho-dynamics between MMF and MFF for example
* sense the center of your partner. why?
    * to connect yours with theirs. to use this connection for lifts. to put your center onto theirs. to only give weight into that center into the ground (otherwise push the partner off-balance). the only way to safely share weight.
* how to dance with a beginner as an advanced?
    * don't tell, but inspire; be a role-model and lead by example
    * convey the basics through the dance (grounding, push them gently, making it clear; sharing weight by leaning gently, gradually; rolling point of contact and slight force into pathway continuation)
    * be patient, go slow; don't get frustrated (you too started once, how would you have been liked to be treated; or when you join another dance class in a different style/school?!)
    * if nothing works: talk, use words; even more needed: take a break, create adhoc-examples; always compliment them of improvements (nicely done, great, good)
    * if yet nothing works; enjoy what is (and focus less on what there isn't)
* how to dance with an advanced as a beginner?
    * TODO
* how to dance the unwanted dance?
    * if your partner goes way too fast, is insensitive, seems to have inappropriate intentions, smells bad, ... TODO
* kinesthetic resonance... TODO: some research about it; sense the other ('s center), peripheric vision; empathy/mirror neurons, ... e.g. contagious yawning; one leans back, the other too (sympathy)
    * kinesthetic resonance: kind of empathy, mirror neurons, "i see you, thus i feel you"; your tension becomes mine (like yawning, irresistible!)
      * speed syncs, we do it consciously or unconsciously (whether we want it or not, difficult to resist); like instruction to sense center of partner
      * like the "jedi skill" while walking: unconscious processing of information and responding to it
        * feeling the result, which simple-minded people call "energy" or assign some metaphysical-esoteric-supernatural phenomenon to it

* to mirror the partner (movement, "energy", quality), to do otherwise feels like betrayal; the disconnect


\section{Partner Dance}\label{sec:partner-dance}

\textit{Disclaimer}: There is lots to tell about dancing with one (or more) partner(s), and this subsection will be far from mentioning all the most relevant there is, but ought to give just a quick glimpse of what might be encountered at the beginning of your CI journey.

Humans are \textbf{social animals}, and as such we have countless neuronal networks dedicated to processing social information, hardwired bonding tendencies leading to the ability to read each other, get in-tuned with each other, ultimately leading to harmony in groups.
Think of basic empathy, which is associated to mirror neurons in our brain, which for example leads us to yawn once we see someone else yawning, or feel the pain we observe in that funny (?) video clip where someone falls from a skateboard.
If we want to feel how someone else is feeling, we might simply want to put our full presence with that person (or even a group) and feel inside our bodies of what's happening; there is a high chance that what we experience is the other person's state of being.
Using a more ``flowery language'', we could say that this is the ability of ``\textit{feel the other person's energy}'' --whatever is supposed to be meant by (mis-)using the word ``energy'' here.

As human beings we also have the innate need to \textbf{be seen} by others; being ignored as one of the worst punishments we can experience, leading to feelings of isolation, exclusion and loneliness.
The biggest present therefore we can give each other is to \textbf{mirror} each other's movements; explicitly acknowledging the other person's existence, putting one's attention to that person, copying his movements, which is also called ``\textit{kinesthetic resonance}''.
Of course counter-mirroring has the same effect (you go down, I go up; you go left, I go right), as it still maintains a form of connection we can play with.




* read people's moving style: says something about/it's based on their past life experiences, their background (dance, acrobatic, ... + how to spot those), personality in general (trust/fear, confidence, self-esteem, easygoing, dare to risk/safe-unsafe risky/courageous, ok to fail/explore/research or play it safe, intimate/distant...), mood today (energy level, emotional state), obviously CI experience/skill
* to find a (potential) dance partner (or join a duo?): make yourself noticeable by dancing in their negative space, like an accordion going in and out, don't stick too close all the time, give space
* be present with your partner, like in the army, got each other's backs; we re-lie on each other, save him when needed, be a team, together (don't break your partner, you won't get another one). the satisfying feeling when you were there when he needed you, almost fell; the quick response, surprising yourself; the feeling of being needed, being of use.
* as a good exercise partner (the passive part), you are very actively engaged about what is being done; you observe your partner where he is, what he needs, see his deficiencies and encourage his possibilities (potential), you anticipate a useful scenario where he can grow (proximal zone of development), when there was the slightest improvement compliment saying something simple as "nice"; serve him, be a little teacher
* how to start a dance?
    * same for joining a single or an existing duo...
    * first dance in proximity, dance negative space.
        * usually no eye contact, but sometimes it helps, and then definitely smile, it makes you more likeable/trustworthy.
        * NEVER approach people from the back (they can't see you) and especially NEVER touch right away; no possibility for consent there
    * WAIT - so they are aware of your presence and intention.
    * be attentative to response of you; are they moving towards or away from you?
    * if towards: do some "grasing", backs of arms. usually start back2back.
    * if away: also retreat, respect the people's no, and preferably not take it personally (it might be, but you don't know)
        * recover, shake it off, and try again
        * if you really dare, you can ask the people afterwards about what happened, and how they interpreted it; ask for feedback, what you could have done differently (different approaching, take a shower, change behavior); use it to improve, not to push yourself down.
* guide how to dis/engage a dance: mirror the person, bit eye contact, finger/hand touch, back2back; disengage namaste/hug, use water drinking as excuse, say thank you and roll away
DIS/ENGAGE:
* the FIRST DANCE, on an interpersonal level:
  * getting to know each other. start super slow and easy.
  * ASK questions (sending a clear and deliberate signal, e.g. manipulate or a clear dominate/active or submissive/passive move, offering/requesting a lift) and be super perceptive/susceptible for the answer (receiving a clear yes or no, thus inferring your partner's personality/preferences/dislikes)
  * it's like romantic relationships:
    * don't go too fast, don't over-invest in the beginning because you are super enthusiastic
    * instead be APPROPRIATE and PROPORTIONAL to what is (at the beginning very little, and build up over time)
    * check each other out, and let go of any prejudgments you might have, and empty yourself, free yourself, and let yourself be surprised.
  * even a small HANDSHAKE can reveal so much about the other person
  * how to start a dance: to make it clear/explicit: although usually not common, make eye contact (+smile) for a short moment
* the "other end" of starting a dance = ENDING it
  * make it clear, be honest and direct (matter of respect); e.g. namaste sign, say "thank you", or just "i prefer not to dance with you because ..." (moving too fast, i don't feel safe; i have a need for...)
    * feel free to give honest feedback, how else should we learn; we also would like to hear our mistakes so we can improve on them, instead of falsely believing we are flawless perfect beings in every aspect
  * don't use excuses, don't lie (e.g. have to drink some water), as otherwise people will come back to you (misunderstanding => conflict)
  * it's much about consent/safety, to do it right
  * after having disengaged, "shake it off" (arms or whole body), literally (physically) but also figuratively (psychologically)
    * sometimes, a quick body shake can be enough, to continue; like ginger in-between to neutralize the taste
    * intention to clear oneself from your "partner's energy", to reset, start fresh
* how to build trust? pattern continuation principle: predictability, thus trust
  * also rolling of point contact principle: predictability, no "extreme octopus" (like from ecstatic dance, expression of chaos, no clarity, no trust)

* sex differences: men are stiff, women are unstable.
  * men+men: afraid of intimacy (homophobia?), competition? little softness to surrender, more (play-)fighting
  * men+women: no egalitarian anymore, clear (social-stereotypical) rules (many (smaller) women are lifted against their will, grabbed; THAT's AN ISSUE!!!)
  * as a big guy: not being lifted at all (if dance only/mostly with women); then more like typical lead/follow roles
* giving feedback: how else shall we learn/grow/improve? how to do it?
  * especially if i dislike something: smell, too fast, not listening, insensitive, ...
  * sometimes we don't know, so please tell, to be aware and have at least a chance to change.
  * how to say "no" to an invitation (in negative space; no surprise to partner immediately jump to touch!), during the dance (stopping it)
  * is the "investment" worth it, to tell people?
    * is it short-term then maybe not; like educating tourists about them being unaware of traffic; too many of them, and gone in a day again
    * is it long-term; an ongoing class, then yes
      * you'll see them many times, so you will benefit from it)
      * is it even changeable: smell, then change shirt/shower or is it his face, because surgery maybe not going to happen
  * psychological plane:
    * triggers, projections; something is touching our own values (cultural differences, mostly unaware; we differ, but there are no absolutes)
    * judgments (negative and positive ones)... own them, express and not suppress.
* different personality, different preferences:
  * dance by yourself/solo, distance with others, with dedicated partner, trio, group
  * easy-goingness with touch and intimacy (roll over front-side)
  * groundedness = calm, safe, confident, trust
  * fast/slow, cold/firey
* finding a partner: can be tricky for some. sociometer/popularity thing, being liked/belonging; also male/female tension, desire, the thought of "is it allowed?"
* starting a dance (once partner is already assigned):
  * begin with negative space first, important! don't go in contact right away
  * to "warm up", like a foreplay, to get attuned to each other, synchronize, align, to agree to a style
  * otherwise, it will be more bumpy and difficult "to find each other"
* correct your partner non-verbally as much as possible
  * only if not working, then use words, say something (keep it short though, single word; like "breathe" or "ground" or "slow")
  * e.g. grounding => push them, if just moving away, push vertical (ground them; push pelvis)
  * e.g. pathway breaking => use a bit more force/insist on the trajectory
  * e.g. stiff => speed up; e.g. wobbly/unstable => slow done
* dancing with a new/unknown partner; checking them out first: their skill & quality
  * for safety reason as well! not only to attune/sync each other, to improve the dance
  * e.g. don't fall into them, lean, off balance, otherwise both will fall; as partner without grounding can't support, unstable

* the magic moment when "dancing with the big body"; dancing with everybody, secretly (without them knowing); feeling connected, belonging (spiritual practice?!)
* why do we depersonalize the dance partner? isn't it devaluing?
* ad tantric distance: does it mean the partner is constantly in our bed?!
* soft skills: social (start/end/join a dance), boundary/consent is important!
* ad FEEDBACK:
  * feedback is pure data, without judgment (neutral). like a thermostat.
    * see in soccer, when a kid is playing by itself. it doesn't need a coach, because he gets immediate feedback by seeing whether the ball is in or not. also if not, which direction its too far, and can adjust. learning made easy.
    * just reflect objective facts, but avoid interpreting anything.
    * it might be within or not the given exercise.
  * when saying "you did good/bad" we focus on the relational/psychological aspect, which disturbs the learning process. there is an emotional part, which is bigger the closer the person is to us. "where there is light, there is shadow": when we say its good, and the next time we don't say it, it might be considered bad.
* also address issue of men being overly sexual (a dating place?); human urges, unwanted behaviors; also women's inability to express (feel/know?) boundaries (freeze)
* in partner exercises, think for your partner
  * the signal you send, the specific challenge you choose (which body part, which command)
  * being a good exercise partner by being aware on a meta-level; to think ahead, and know what and why you are doing
  * "foerdern durch fordern"; to support by challenge; stay in proximal development area (in learning zone; not comfort, not panic zone)
* get to know your partner (their personality, thus their tendencies of movement), play with it
  * "ask questions and listen carefully", e.g. be more leading/dominant, check whether he is receptive to it, or pushing against it.
  * basically: send signals and await a response form it, forming a more copmlete picture of that person
* social aspect of walking exercise:
  * daring wo evades first (courage competition like two cars at collision course); bit of a power-hierarchy-play; for men, not so much for women
  * we seek close proximity to those we like/are curious about; we keep distance to the others
  * we say hello by getting close; get too close too quickly and you will scare those cats off and away; be sensitive!
- social / how to find a partner: first (way before), 1) know yourself (quality movement, energy levels; slow/fast paced) 2) what are you looking for (someone compatible or be inspired by someone different) and then 3) look on dancefloor for something fitting
  - 2 kind of partners: 1) enjoyable (that hot chick, not much to learn there) or 2) learning/growth (old stinky fat man); depending on how much you can take in that moment, (deliberately) choose one or the other
  - next step: don't eye-gaze, dance in negative space; be receptive whether welcome or not (tension, breathing, looking, moving away/into)
- lots to learn by observing people dancing by themselves; groundedness, speed
* a thin line between dominating (forcing my will upon you) and leading (offering, suggesting, support)
* ad safety culture: try not to smell like "doener kebap", it's just not nice for your partners; meaning: after cooking, bring fresh clothes
* dancing with with someone doing something awkward, something you don't like, how to deal with it?
  * e.g. beginners often break the pathway, most of the time just not aware of it (not necessarily lack of skills, or maybe that as well)
    * pathway breaks, unexpected sudden changes, giving me a shock into my nervous system, very unenjoyable
      * reason probably: many people, especially women, most likely avoid rolling over the front
  * what to do about it?
    * 1. try to push (force) it a bit
    * 2. imitate/mirror your partner, so she hopefully gets aware what she is doing by experiencing it herself (non-teaching teaching, an indirect approach)
    * 3. simply talk, say it, direct approach; after other alternatives failed; what am i observing, what do i need, what can we do about it to improve it; are you ok with it?
    * 4. "if you can't beat them, join them"
      * change it from an "incompatible ingredient" to the main dish; making it an exercise, create one yourself; adapt to the situation what is
        * lemon => lemon juice; omdenken; suffering due to conflict with reality
      * how to enjoy breaking pathways? how to dance with the limitation of only back touching?
    * 5. extreme case: leave it.
  * when level of intimacy doesn't feel ok => learn to set your boundaries without lowering the experience of the dance; stay connected within your comfort zone
    * e.g. using "ballet arms", like a balloon when rolling over the front; or slide over the belly
* a good partner anticipates your future positions, and will be there where needed
  * he has a 3D internal mental model (not needed to see; no visual connection needed)
  * be there to support, "save his ass"
  * how? extend arms, reach with wings; also push into, very strong
  * this enables to build trust, through safety; can i rely on you; allowing to go "higher" (more risky moves)
    * enables you to slighlty go over your limits, as your partner will (hopefully) compensate for your "going over your limits"
* ad feedback: de-scribing an experience is ok, but pre-scribing one is not.
* before the class, what to do?
    * sit, play with phone? lie on ground, do nothing; stretch, do yoga, ballet? walk around, do handstands; or dance?
    * question is: is it really what you need, or do you feel it's more like a habit/fear-avoidance/adapting to the norm?!
        * same as before your ordinary yoga class: everyone in their own -phone- bubble
        * needing a teacher to tell them what to do; independence? self-sufficient?!
    * is it a true, deliberate choice? or just "not otherwise possible"?
* talking is often an excuse to not feel/sense
    * an escape mechanism like (fake) humor/jokes/smiles, to cover up what is
    * attempt to get rid of the discomfort, and not staying with what is; fear of depth/intimacy/vulnerability?! blocking progress/growth
* finding a partner:
    * anxiety evoking for some, totally easy going for the other
    * observe your own tendencies, monitor yourself, without judgment
    * getting chosen or do you choose?
    * who are the ones you like, and those you dislike? (why? what does it say about you? why does it bother you?)
* how to choose the right/a safe/skilled/fitting partner?
    * he needs to be balanced and grounded (no little elephants; landing controlled; small and soft steps, smart feet)
    * use the warm-up (before class; walking) to check out people's movements
    * while dancing:
        * adheres principles: giving sufficient weight for support; rolling point of contact (predictable, no (bad) surprises); pouring weight (no jumping)
        * healthy collaboration; no pure lead (toxic masc) or follow (toxic fem)
* the dynamics in a dance:
    * solo: i can do whatever (monarchy, xi jinping)
    * duo: i could overrule with my intention, force (fake democracy)
    * trio: impossible to manipulate. full-on listen-only (minority in democracy)
    * ... "strange", other people have needs of their own. they have a will which i cannot control/dictate. cumbersome...
* the social/group-dynamics realm "underneath"
    * observe, e.g., who dances (how) with whom
    * who cuddles with whom, who's cozy, or not at all; feeling safe, intimate; who anxious/unsafe?
    * when there is a little elephant/screaming/bumping - always the same people?
    * "same stays with same": old/young, beginner/advanced; even same hair type, clothes, ...
* qualities of movement = personality reflection
    * dancing wildly, unpredictable, for those who trust more + are risk-inclined (or just not enough experience yet?!)
    * observe your own tendency in both roles; more passive/active; listen/manipulate; follower/lead
* basic protocol to adhere:
    * no shirts with buttons (you might get stuck); also no jewelry (ear rings, necklaces, rings...)
    * wear comfy pyjamas instead. we don't dress to impress ;) we are authentic and humans just as we are
    * no sleeveless shirts (yeah, you look cool), but for hygiene’s sake
        * also no sliding possible with skin (long sleeves better)
        * best bring multiple shirts anyway (sweaty)
* OPEN QUESTION: the t-shirt mystery: why does it always move up when doing floor work/rolling???
    * possible reasons: shirt specifics / the movement itself / the body shape
* ass, titties, penises... it's just tissue. it's not a thing, as long as you don't create a story around it
* "good dancers start slow"; with people you already know, you can also have fast quickies (trust yet established)
* dancing (CI) is like sex:
    * most people are self-centered, focus on themselves, not really listening, like "using the other's body to masturbate themselves"
        * also present in ordinary communication:
            * most of the conversations are two parallel monologues, no one is listening; no mutual exchange
            * there are rarely true dialogues happening, where we truly see each other, acknowledge, and stay empathetically present
    * most dominant (men) immediately penetrate, without preparation/foreplay/warm-up, without consent
        * they control, manipulate; egoistically; would need some negative space dance before
            * like dog's ass sniffing; get to know each other, calibrate/adjust to each other('s frequency/energy/aura/chakra/whatever)
            * our society's "hook-up mentality" is superficial, too much into quick pleasures
                * hedonistic; good is what feels good; always be happy
                * it takes a lot of time to get to know each other properly first, which comes with some hard work and discomfort
    * some people have no clue, they do weird stuff because they just don't know
    * real depth, for advanced, is slow and subtle
* Gestalt prayer:
    I do my thing and you do your thing.
    I am not in this world to live up to your expectations,
    And you are not in this world to live up to mine.
    You are you, and I am I,
    and if by chance we find each other, it's beautiful.
    If not, it can't be helped.
    * living in response to one's own needs, without projecting onto/taking introjects from others
        * introjection (also known as identification or internalization): the unconscious adoption of the thoughts or personality traits of others. It occurs as a normal part of development, such as a child taking on parental values and attitudes. It can also be a defense mechanism in situations that arouse anxiety. It has been associated with both normal and pathological development.
    * by fulfilling our own needs that we can help others do the same and create space for genuine contact
