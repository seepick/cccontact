# Crash Course Contact

A free (as in free beer, not free speech) book about __Contact Improvisation__. 

CI is an art-form, something between sports, dance, martial arts and acrobatics.
It is not only about the physical movement, but reveals deeper layers of the human being and the human experience.
Thus, it could be said to be a spiritual practice, or at least something in the direction of personal development.

The book started as an intention to summarize some basic FAQ being asked, together with some personal notes taken during classes and workshops.
Over the time it grew and grew more, adding content from different sources, and evolved into a more structured compendium about CI.

You can get a free PDF of it, or let it be printed (and shipped) at your own costs without any profit being made.
