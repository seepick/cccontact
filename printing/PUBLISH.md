PUBLISHING
====================================================================================================

what to do first?

* let content be checked by CI practitioners
* let grammar/spelling/wording checked by professionals (julien knows)
* get licensing right

EMBED FONTS
----------------------------------------------------
open your pdf file,
select file -> print
set your printer to be Adobe printer (assuming you already installed it)
click on properties
click the tab "Adobe PDF Settings"
uncheck "Rely on system fonts only; do not use document fonts"
click on the Edit... after Default Settings
click on Fonts, add those missing fonts to "Always Embed" (It is recommended to save the properties as a new setting.)
print the pdf file with the new settings, and your new pdf file should be good to go.
Tip: when (or if) it asks you to save the PDF settings file, save it in the suggested Adobe settings folder
